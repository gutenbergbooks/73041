<p>Of indoor entertainments, the truest and most human
is conversation.—<span class="smcap">Mark Pattison.</span></p>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">In</span> an age when everybody is writing Reminiscences,
and when nothing is left untold, we
hear a great deal about the wit and brilliancy
of former days and former conversations.
Elderly gentlemen, conscious of an ever increasing
dulness in life, would fain have us
believe that its more vivacious characteristics
vanished with their youth, and can never be
tempted to return. Mournful prophecies anent
the gradual decay of social gifts assail us on
every side. Mr. Justin McCarthy, recalling
with a sigh the group of semi-distinguished
men who were wont to grace George Eliot’s
Sunday afternoons, can “only hope that the
art of talking is not destined to die out with
the art of letter-writing.” Mr. George W.
E. Russell entertains similar misgivings. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
found his ideal talker in Mr. Matthew Arnold,
“a man of the world without being frivolous,
and a man of letters without being pedantic;”
and he considers this admirable combination
as necessary as it is rare. American chroniclers
point back to a little gleaming band of
Northern lights, and assure us sadly that if
we never heard these men in their prime, we
must live and die uncheered by wit or wisdom.
We are born in a barren day.</p>

<p>But conversation, the luxury of conversation,
as De Quincey happily phrases it, does
not depend upon one or two able talkers. It
is not, and never has been, a question of stars,
but of a good stock company. Neither can it
decay like the art—or the habit—of letter-writing.
The conditions are totally different.
Letters form a by-path of literature, a charming,
but occasional, retreat for people of cultivated
leisure. Conversation in its happiest
development is a link, equally exquisite and
adequate, between mind and mind, a system
by which men approach one another with sympathy
and enjoyment, a field for the finest
amenities of civilization, for the keenest and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
most intelligent display of social activity. It
is also our solace, our inspiration, and our
most rational pleasure. It is a duty we owe
to one another; it is our common debt to
humanity. “God has given us tongues,” writes
Heine, “wherewith we may say pleasant things
to our neighbours.” To refuse a service so
light, so sweet, so fruitful, is to be unworthy
of the inheritance of the ages.</p>

<p>It is claimed again, by critics disposed to
be pessimistic, that our modern development
of “specialism” is prejudicial to good conversation.
A man devoted to one subject can
seldom talk well upon any other. Unless his
companions share his tastes and his knowledge,
he must—a sad alternative—either lecture or
be still. There are people endowed with such
a laudable thirst for information that they
relish lectures,—professional and gratuitous.
They enjoy themselves most when they are
being instructed. They are eager to form an
audience. Such were the men and women who
experienced constant disappointment because
Mr. Browning, a specialist of high standing,
declined to discuss his specialty. No side-lights<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
upon “Sordello” could be extracted from him.
We realize how far the spirit of the lecture had
intruded upon the spirit of conversation forty
years ago, when Mr. Bagehot admitted that,
with good modern talkers, “the effect seems to
be produced by that which is stated, and not by
the manner in which it is stated,”—a reversal of
ancient rules. We are aware of its still further
encroachment when we see a little book by
M. Charles Rozan, characteristically christened
“<span lang="fr">Petites Ignorances de la Conversation</span>,” and
find it full of odds and ends of information, of
phrases, allusions, quotations, facts,—all the
minute details which are presumably embodied
in the talk of educated men. The world to-day
devoutly believes that everything can be taught
and learned. When we have been shown how
a thing is done, we can of course do it. There
are even little manuals composed with serious
simplicity, the object of which is to enable us
to meet specialists on their own grounds; to
discuss art with artists, literature with authors,
politics with politicians, science with scientists,—the
last, surely, a dangerous experiment.
“Conversation,” I read in one of these enchanting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
primers, “cannot be entirely learned
from books,”—a generous admission in a day
given over to the worship of print.</p>

<p>But in good truth, the contagious ardour,
the urbane freedom of the spoken word lift it
immeasurably from the regions of pen and
ink. Those “shy revelations of affinity,” which
now and then open to the reader sweet vistas
of familiarity and friendship, are frequent, alluring,
persuasive, in well-ordered speech. It
is not what we learn in conversation that enriches
us. It is the elation that comes of swift
contact with tingling currents of thought. It
is the opening of our mental pores, and the
stimulus of marshaling our ideas in words, of
setting them forth as gallantly and as graciously
as we can. “A language long employed
by a delicate and critical society,” says Mr.
Bagehot, “is a treasure of dexterous felicities;”
and the recognition of these felicities, the grading
of terms, the enlarging of a narrow and
stupid vocabulary make the charm of civilized
social contact. Discussion without asperity,
sympathy without fusion, gayety unracked by
too abundant jests, mental ease in approaching<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
one another,—these are the things which give
a pleasant smoothness to the rough edge of
life.</p>

<p>So much has been said about good talkers,—brilliant
soloists for the most part,—and
so little about good talk! So much has been
said about good listeners, and so little about
the interchange of thought! “Silent people
never spoil company,” remarked Lord Chesterfield;
but even this negative praise was probably
due to the type of silence with which he
was best acquainted,—a habit of sparing
speech, not the muffled stillness of genuine
and hopeless incapacity. A man who listens
because he has nothing to say can hardly be a
source of inspiration. The only listening that
counts is that of the talker who alternately
absorbs and expresses ideas. Sainte-Beuve
says of Fontenelle that, while he had neither
tears nor laughter, he smiled at wit, never interrupted,
was never excited, nor ever in a hurry
to speak. These are endearing traits. They
embody much of the art of conversation. But
they are as remote from unadorned silence as
from unconsidered loquacity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span></p>

<p>The same distinction may be drawn between
the amenity which forbids bickering, and the
flabbiness which has neither principles to uphold,
nor arguments with which to uphold
them. Hazlitt’s counsel, “You should prefer
the opinion of the company to your own,” is
good in the main, but it can easily be pushed
too far. Proffered by a man who bristled with
opinions which he never wearied of defending,
it is perhaps more interesting than persuasive.
If everybody floated with the tide of talk, placidity
would soon end in stagnation. It is the
strong backward stroke which stirs the ripples,
and gives animation and variety. “Unison is
a quality altogether obnoxious in conversation,”
said Montaigne, who was at least as
tolerant as Hazlitt was combative, but who
dearly loved stout words from honest men.
Dr. Johnson, we know, was of a similar way
of thinking. He scorned polite tepidity; he
hated chatter; he loved that unfeeling logic
which drives mercilessly to its goal. No man
knew better than he the unconvincing nature
of argument. He had too often thrust
his friends from the fortress of sound reason<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
which they were not strong enough to hold.
But his talk, for all its aggressiveness, and for
all its tendency to negation, was real talk; not—as
with Coleridge—a monologue, nor—as
with Macaulay—a lecture. He did not infringe
upon other people’s conversational freeholds,
and he was not, be it always remembered,
anecdotal. The man who lived upon
“potted stories” inspired him with righteous
antipathy.</p>

<p>Perhaps the saddest proof of intellectual
inertia, of our failure to meet one another with
ease and understanding, is the tendency to
replace conversation by story-telling. It is no
uncommon thing to hear a man praised as a
good talker, when he is really a good <i lang="fr">raconteur</i>.
People will speak complacently of a “brilliant
dinner,” at which strings of anecdotes,
disconnected and illegitimate, have usurped the
field, to the total exclusion of ideas. After an
entertainment of this order—like a feast of
buns and barley sugar—we retire with mental
indigestion for a fortnight. That it should
be relished betrays the crudeness of social
conditions. “Of all the bores,” writes De<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
Quincey with unwonted ill-temper, “whom
man in his folly hesitates to hang, and Heaven
in its mysterious wisdom suffers to propagate
his species, the most insufferable is the teller
of good stories.” This is a hard saying. The
story, like its second cousin the lie, has a
sphere of usefulness. It is a help in moments
of emergency, and it serves admirably to illustrate
a text. But it is not, and never can be,
a substitute for conversation. People equipped
with reason, sentiment, and a vocabulary
should have something to talk about, some
common ground on which they can meet, and
penetrate into one another’s minds. The exquisite
pleasure of interchanging ideas, of
awakening to suggestions, of finding sympathy
and companionship, is as remote from the languid
amusement yielded by story-telling as a
good play is remote from the bald diversion of
the music hall.</p>

<p>Something to talk about appears to be the
first consideration. The choice of a topic, or
rather the possession of a topic which will
bear analysis and support enthusiasm, is essential
to the enjoyment of conversation. We<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
cannot go far along a stony track. Diderot
observed that whenever he was in the company
of men and women who were reading Richardson’s
books, either privately or aloud, the talk
was sure to be animated and interesting. Some
secret springs of emotion were let loose by
this great master of sentiment. Our ancestors
allowed themselves a wider field of discussion
than we are now in the habit of conceding;
but after all, as Stevenson reminds us, “it is
not over the virtues of a curate-and-tea-party
novel that people are abashed into high resolutions.”
We may not covet Socratic discourses
at the dinner table, but neither can we long
sustain what has been sadly and significantly
called “the burden of conversation” on the
lines adopted by William the Fourth, who,
when he felt the absolute necessity of saying
something, asked the Duke of Devonshire
where he meant to be buried.</p>

<p>The most perfect and pitiful pictures of intercourse
stripped bare of interest have been
given us in Miss Austen’s novels. Reading
them, we grow sick at heart to think what
depths of experience they reflect, what hours of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
ennui lie back of every page. The conversation
of the ladies after Mrs. John Dashwood’s dinner
must stand forever as a perfect example
of sustained stupidity, of that almost miraculous
dulness which can be achieved only by
“want of sense, want of elegance, want of
spirits, and want of temper.” Equal to it in
its way is the brief description of Lady Middleton’s
first call upon the Dashwoods.</p>

<p>“Conversation was not lacking, for Sir
John was very chatty, and Lady Middleton
had taken the wise precaution of bringing
with her their eldest child, a fine little boy
about six years old. By this means there was
one subject always to be recurred to by the
ladies in case of extremity, for they had to enquire
his name and age, admire his beauty,
and ask him questions which his mother answered
for him, while he hung about her and
held down his head, to the great surprise of
her ladyship, who wondered at his being so
shy before company, as he could make noise
enough at home. On every formal visit a child
ought to be of the party, by way of provision
for discourse. In the present case, it took up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
ten minutes to determine whether the boy
were most like his father or mother, and in
what particular he resembled either, for of
course everybody differed, and everybody was
astonished at the opinion of the others.”</p>

<p>How real it is! How many of us have lived
through similar half-hours, veiling with decent
melancholy the impetuous protest of our souls!</p>

<p>Charles Greville is responsible for the rather
unusual statement that a dinner at which all
the guests are fools is apt to be as agreeable as
a dinner at which all the guests are clever men.
The fools, he says, are tolerably sure to be gay,
and the clever men are perfectly sure to be
heavy. How far the gayety of fools is an engaging
trait it might be difficult to decide (there
is a text which throws some doubt upon the subject),
but Greville appears to have suffered a
good deal from the ponderous society of the
learned. We are struck in the first place by
the very serious topics which made the table-talk
of his day. Do people now discuss primogeniture
in ancient Rome over their fish and
game? It sounds almost as onerous as the Socratic
discourses. Then again it was his special<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
hardship to listen to the dissertations of Macaulay,
and he resented this infliction with all
the ardour of a vain and accomplished man.
“Macaulay’s astonishing knowledge is every
moment exhibited,” he writes in his Memoirs,
“but he is not agreeable. He has none of the
graces of conversation, none of the exquisite
tact and refinement which are the result of a
felicitous intuition, or of a long acquaintance
with good society.... <em>His information is
more than society requires.</em>”</p>

<p>The last line is a master-stroke of criticism.
It embodies all that goes before and all that
follows,—for Greville airs his grievance at
length,—and it is admirably illustrated in his
account of that famous evening at Holland
House, when Lady Holland, in captious mood,
rebelled against a course of instruction. Somebody
having chanced to mention Sir Thomas
Munro, the hostess rashly admitted that she had
never heard of him, whereupon Macaulay “explained
all he had said, done, written, or thought,
and vindicated his claim to the title of a great
man, till Lady Holland, getting bored, said she
had had enough of Sir Thomas, and would hear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
no more. This might have dashed and silenced
an ordinary talker; but to Macaulay it was no
more than replacing a book upon the shelf, and
he was just as ready as ever to open on any other
topic.” The Fathers of the Church were next
discussed (it was not a frivolous company),
and Macaulay at once called to mind a sermon
of Saint Chrysostom’s in praise of the Bishop
of Antioch. “He proceeded to give us the substance
of this sermon till Lady Holland got
tired of the Fathers, and put her extinguisher
on Chrysostom as she had done on Munro.
Then with a sort of derision, and as if to have
the pleasure of puzzling Macaulay, she turned
to him and said: ‘Pray what was the origin of
a doll? When were dolls first mentioned in
history?’ Macaulay, however, was just as much
up in dolls as in the Fathers, and instantly replied
that the Roman children had their dolls,
which they offered to Venus when they grew
older. He quoted <span class="locked">Persius,—</span></p>

<p class="center" lang="la">
‘Veneri donatae a virgine puppae,’
</p>

<p class="in0">and I have not the least doubt that if he had
been allowed to proceed, he would have told<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
us who was the Chenevix of ancient Rome,
and the name of the first baby that ever
handled a doll.”</p>

<p>This was indeed more information than society
required. It is not surprising that Sydney
Smith, perhaps the most charming talker
of his day, was quickly silenced by such an
avalanche of words, and sat mute and limp in
the historian’s company. Upon one occasion
Greville went to visit the Marquis of Lansdowne
at Bowood, and found Macaulay among
the guests. “It was wonderful how quiet the
house seemed after he had gone,” comments
the diarist grimly, “and it was not less agreeable.”</p>

<p>That a rude invasion of the field is fatal to
the enjoyment of intercourse we know from
the sentiment of revolt expressed on every
side. How little the people who heard Mme.
de Staël’s brilliant conversation appear to have
relished the privilege! Mackintosh admitted
that she was agreeable in a tête-à-tête, but too
much for a general assembly. Heine hated
her, as a hurricane in petticoats. “She hears
but little, and never the truth, because she is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
always talking.” Byron, who felt a genuine
admiration for her cleverness, and was grateful
for her steadfast friendship, confessed ruefully
that she overwhelmed him with words,
buried him beneath glittering snow and nonsense.
The art of being amusing in a lovable
way was not hers; yet this is essentially the
art which lifted French conversation to its
highest level, which made it famous three
hundred years ago, and which has preserved it
ever since as a rational and engaging occupation.
A page of history lies revealed and elucidated
in Saint-Simon’s little sentence anent
Mme. de Maintenon’s fashion of speech. “Her
language was gentle, exact, well chosen, and
naturally eloquent and brief.”</p>

<p>No wonder she reigned long. Eloquent and
brief! What a magnificent “blend”! How
persuasive the “well-chosen” words, immaculately
free from harsh emphasis and the feminine
fault of iteration! Who would not be
influenced by a woman who talked always well,
and never too much; who, knowing the value
of flattery, administered it with tact and moderation;
and who shrank instinctively from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
exaggerated terms which destroy balance and
invite defeat? From the reign of Louis the
Fourteenth to the Revolution, conversation was
cultivated in France with intelligent assiduity.
Its place in the fabric of civilization was clearly
understood. No time was begrudged to its development,
no labour was spared to its perfecting.
Mr. Henry James is of the opinion that
it flowered brilliantly in the middle of the
eighteenth century. “This was surely,” he
says, “in France at least, the age of good society,
the period when the right people made
haste to be born in time. The sixty years that
preceded the Revolution were the golden age
of fireside talk, and of those amenities that
are due to the presence of women in whom
the social art is both instinctive and acquired.
The women of that period were, above all,
good company. The fact is attested in a thousand
documents. Chenonceaux offered a perfect
setting to free conversation; and infinite
joyous discourse must have mingled with the
liquid murmur of the Cher.”</p>

<p>“Joyous discourse” is a beguiling phrase.
It carries with it the echo of laughter long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
since silenced,—light laughter following the
light words, so swiftly spoken, yet so surely
placed. The time was coming fast when this
smooth graciousness of speech would inspire
singular mistrust, and when Rousseau—ardently
embracing nature—would write of the
“fine and delicate irony called politeness, which
gives so much ease and pliability to the intercourse
of civilized man, enabling him to assume
the appearance of every virtue without
the reality of one.” Later on, illusions being
dispelled, the painful discovery was made that
the absence of politeness does not necessarily
imply the presence of virtue, and that taciturnity
may be wholly disassociated with the
truth. We owe to one another all the wit and
good humour we can command; and nothing
so clears our mental vistas as sympathetic and
intelligent conversation. It can never languish
in an age like ours, teeming with new interests
widely shared, and with new wonders
widely known. We must talk, because we have
so much to talk about; and we ought to talk
well, because our inspirations are of a noble
order. Each new discovery made by science,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
each fresh emotion awakened by contemporaneous
history, each successive pleasure yielded
by literature or by art is a spur to rational
speech. These things are our common heritage,
and we share them in common, through the
medium of the aptly spoken word.</p>

<p>Grief is the sister of doubt and ill-temper, and, beyond
all spirits, destroyeth man.—<cite>Shepherd of Hermas.</cite></p>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">In</span> the beginning of the last century an ingenious
gentleman, Mr. James Beresford, Fellow
of Merton College, Oxford, diverted himself
and—let us hope—his friends, by drawing
up and publishing an exhaustive list of the
minor miseries of life. It is a formidable
document, realistic in character, and ill calculated
to promote the spirit of content. No one
would ever imagine that so many disagreeable
things could happen in the ordinary course of
existence, until the possibilities of each and
every one are plainly and pitilessly defined.
Some of these possibilities have passed away
in the hundred years that lie between King
George’s day and ours; but others remain for
our better discipline and subjection. Political
discussions at the dinner-table rank high among
Mr. Beresford’s grievances; also weak tea,—“an
infusion of balm, sage, and rosemary,” he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
calls it,—and “being expected to be interested
in a baby.”</p>

<p>A great deal of modern literature, and not
a little modern conversation, closely resemble
this unhappy gentleman’s “black list.” There
is the same earnest desire to point out what
we would rather not observe. Life is so full
of miseries, minor and major; they press so
close upon us at every step of the way, that it
is hardly worth while to call one another’s attention
to their presence. People who do this
thing on a more imposing scale than Mr.
Beresford are spoken of respectfully as “unfaltering
disciples of truth,” or as “incapable
of childish self-delusion,” or as “looking with
clear eyes into life’s bitter mysteries;” whereas
in reality they are merely dwelling on the
obvious, and the obvious is the one thing not
worth consideration. We are all painfully
aware of the seamy side, because we are
scratched by the seams. What we want to
contemplate is the beauty and the smoothness
of that well-ordered plan which it is so difficult
for us to discern. When Burke counselled a
grave and anxious gentleman to “live pleasant,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
he was turning him aside from the ordinary
aspects of existence.</p>

<p>There is a charming and gracious dogma
of Roman Catholicism which would have us
believe that all good deeds and holy prayers
make up a spiritual treasury, a public fund,
from which are drawn consolation for the
church suffering, and strength for the church
militant. A similar treasury (be it reverently
spoken) holds for us all the stored-up laughter
of the world, and from it comes human help
in hours of black dejection. Whoever enriches
this exchequer should be held a benefactor of
his race. Whoever robs it—no matter what
heroic motives he may advance in extenuation
of the deed—has sinned heavily against his
fellow men. For the gayety of life, like the
beauty and the moral worth of life, is a saving
grace, which to ignore is folly, and to destroy
is crime. There is no more than we need,—there
is barely enough to go round. If we
waste our little share, if we extinguish our little
light, the treasury is that much poorer,
and our neighbour walks in gloom.</p>

<p>The thinkers of the world should by rights<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
be the guardians of the world’s mirth; but
thinking is a sorry business, and a period of
critical reflection, following a period of vigorous
and engrossing activity, is apt to breed
the “plaintive pessimist,” whose self-satisfaction
is disproportionate to his worth. Literature,
we are assured by its practitioners, “exists
to please;” but it has some doubtful
methods of imparting pleasure. If, indeed, we
sit down to read books on degeneracy and
kindred topics, we have no reason to complain
of what we find in them. It is not
through such gates as these that we seek an
escape from mortality. But why should poets
and essayists and novelists be so determinedly
depressing? Why should “the earnest
prophetic souls who tear the veil from our
illusory national prosperity”—I quote from
a recent review—be so warmly praised for
their vandalism? Heaven knows they are always
tearing the veil from something, until
there is hardly a rag left for decency. Yet
there are few nudities so objectionable as the
naked truth. Granted that our habit of exaggerating
the advantages of modern civilization<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
and of modern culture does occasionally provoke
and excuse plain speaking, there is no
need of a too merciless exposure, a too insulting
refutation of these agreeable fallacies. If we
think ourselves well off, we <em>are</em> well off. If,
dancing in chains, we believe ourselves free, we
<em>are</em> free, and he is not our benefactor who weighs
our shackles. Reformers have unswervingly
and unpityingly decreased the world’s content
that they might better the world’s condition.
The first part of their task is quickly done.
The second halts betimes. Count Tolstoi has,
with the noblest intentions, made many a light
step heavy, and many a gay heart sad.</p>

<p>As for poets and novelists, their sin is unprovoked
and unpardonable. Story-telling is
not a painful duty. It is an art which, in its
best development, adds immeasurably to the
conscious pleasure of life. It is an anodyne in
hours of suffering, a rest in hours of weariness,
and a stimulus in hours of health and joyous
activity. It can be made a vehicle for imparting
instruction, for destroying illusions, and
for dampening high spirits; but these results,
though well thought of in our day, are not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
essential to success. Want and disease are
mighty factors in life; but they have never
yet inspired a work of art. The late Professor
Boyesen has indeed recorded his unqualified
delight at the skill with which Russian novelists
describe the most unpleasant maladies.
He said enthusiastically that, after reading
one of these masterpieces, he felt himself
developing some of the very symptoms which
had been so accurately portrayed; but to many
readers this would be scant recommendation.
It is not symptoms we seek in stories. The
dullest of us have imagination enough to invent
them for ourselves.</p>

<p>“Poverty,” said old Robert Burton, “is a
most odious calling,” and it has not grown any
more enjoyable in the past three hundred years.
Nothing is less worth while than to idealize its
discomforts, unless it be to sourly exaggerate
them. There is no life so hard as to be without
compensations, especially for those who take
short views; and the view of poverty seldom
goes beyond the needs of the hour and their
fulfilment. But there has arisen of late years
a school of writers—for the most part English,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
though we have our representatives—who
paint realistically the squalor and wretchedness
of penury, without admitting into their
pictures one ray of the sunshine that must
sometimes gild the dreariest hovel or the
meanest street. A notable example of this
black art was Mr. George Gissing, whose
novels are too powerful to be ignored, and too
depressing to be forgotten. The London of the
poor is not a cheerful place; it is perhaps the
most cheerless place in Christendom; but this
is the way it appeared in Mr. Gissing’s eyes
when he was compelled to take a suburban
<span class="locked">train:—</span></p>

<p>“Over the pest-stricken region of East
London, sweltering in sunlight which served
only to reveal the intimacies of abomination;
across miles of a city of the damned, such as
thought never conceived before this age of
ours; above streets swarming with a nameless
populace, cruelly exposed by the unwonted
light of heaven; stopping at stations which
it crushes the heart to think should be the
destination of any mortal,—the train made
its way at length beyond the outmost limits of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
dread, and entered upon a land of level meadows,
of hedges and trees, of crops and cattle.”</p>

<p>Surely this is a trifle strained. The “nameless
populace” would be not a little surprised
to hear itself described with such dark eloquence.
I remember once encountering in a
third-class English railway carriage a butcher-boy—he
confided to me his rank and profession—who
waxed boastful over the size and
wealth of London. “It’s the biggest city in
the world, that’s wot it is; it’s got five millions
of people in it, that’s wot it’s got; and
I’m a Londoner, that’s wot I am,” he said,
glowing with pride that was not without
merit in one of mean estate. The “city of the
damned” appeared a city of the gods to this
young son of poverty.</p>

<p>Such books sin against the gayety of life.</p>

</div>

<p class="in0">and there is no form of sadness more wasteful
than that which is bred of a too steadfast
consideration of pain. It is not generosity of
spirit which feeds this mood. The sorrowful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
acceptance of life’s tragedies is of value only
when it prompts us to guard more jealously,
or to impart more freely, life’s manifold benefactions.
Mr. Pater has subtly defined the
mental attitude which is often mistaken for
sympathy, but which is a mere ineffectual
yielding to depression over the sunless scenes
of earth.</p>

<p>“He”—Carl of Rosenmold—“had fits of
the gloom of other people, their dull passage
through and exit from the world, the threadbare
incidents of their lives, their dismal funerals,
which, unless he drove them away immediately
by strenuous exercise, settled into a gloom more
properly his own. Yet, at such times, outward
things would seem to concur unkindly in deepening
the mental shadows about him.”</p>

<p>This is precisely the temper which finds expression
in much modern verse. Its perpetrators
seem wrapped in endless contemplation of
other people’s gloom, until, having absorbed all
they can hold, they relieve their oppressed souls
by unloading it in song. Women are especially
prone to mournful measures, and I am
not without sympathy for that petulant English<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
critic who declined to read their poetry on the
plea that it was “all dirges.” But men can be
mourners, too, <span class="locked">and—</span></p>

<p class="in0">is too often the burden of their verse, the unsolicited
assurance with which they cheer us on
our way. We do not believe them, of course,
except in moments of dejection; but these are
just the moments in which we would like to
hear something different. When our share of
gayety is running pitifully low, and the sparks
of joy are dying on life’s hearth, we have no
courage to laugh down the voices of those who,
“wilfully living in sadness, speak but the truths
thereof.”</p>

<p>Hazlitt, who was none too happy, but who
strove manfully for happiness, used to say that
he felt a deeper obligation to Northcote than to
any of his other friends who had done him far
greater service, because Northcote’s conversation
was invariably gay and agreeable. “I never
ate nor drank with him; but I have lived on
his words with undiminished relish ever since
I can remember; and when I leave him, I come<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
out into the street with feelings lighter and
more ethereal than I have at any other time.”
Here is a debt of friendship worth recording,
and blither hearts than Hazlitt’s have treasured
similar benefactions. Mr. Robert Louis Stevenson
gladly acknowledged his gratitude to
people who set him smiling when they came his
way, or who smiled themselves from sheer cheerfulness
of heart. They never knew—not posing
as philanthropists—how far they helped
him on his road; but he knew, and has thanked
them in words not easily <span class="locked">forgotten:—</span></p>

<p>“There is no duty we so much underrate as
the duty of being happy. By being happy we
sow anonymous benefits upon the world, which
remain unknown even to ourselves, or, when
they are disclosed, surprise nobody so much as
the benefactor.... A happy man or woman
is a better thing to find than a five-pound note.
He or she is a radiating focus of good-will;
and their entrance into a room is as though
another candle had been lighted.”</p>

<p>There is little doubt that the somewhat indiscriminate
admiration lavished upon Mr. Stevenson
himself was due less to his literary than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
to his personal qualities. People loved him, not
because he was an admirable writer, but because
he was a cheerful consumptive. There has been
far too much said about his ill health, and nothing
is so painful to contemplate as the lack
of reserve on the part of relatives and executors
which thrusts every detail of a man’s life before
the public eye. It provokes maudlin sentiment
on the one side, and ungracious asperity
on the other. But, in Mr. Stevenson’s case,
silence is hard to keep. He was a sufferer who
for many years increased the gayety of life.</p>

<p>Genius alone can do this on a large scale;
but everybody can do it on a little one. Our
safest guide is the realization of a hard truth,—that
we are not privileged to share our
troubles with other people. If we could make
up our minds to spare our friends all details
of ill health, of money losses, of domestic annoyances,
of altercations, of committee work,
of grievances, provocations, and anxieties, we
should sin less against the world’s good-humour.
It may not be given us to add to the treasury of
mirth; but there is considerable merit in not
robbing it. I have read that “the most objectionable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
thing in the American manner is excessive
cheerfulness,” and I would like to believe
that so pardonable a fault is the worst we have
to show. It is not our mission to depress, and
one recalls with some satisfaction Saint-Simon’s
remark anent Madame de Maintenon, whom he
certainly did not love. Courtiers less astute
wondered at the enduring charm which this middle-aged
woman, neither handsome nor witty,
had for her royal husband. Saint-Simon held
the clue. It was her “decorous gayety” which
soothed Louis’s tired heart. “She so governed
her humours that, at all times and under all
circumstances, she preserved her cheerfulness
of demeanour.”</p>

<p>There is little profit in asking ourselves or
others whether life be a desirable possession.
It is thrust upon us, without concurrence on our
part. Unless we can abolish compulsory birth,
our relish for the situation is not a controlling
force. “Every child,” we are told, “is sent to
school a hundred years before he is born;” but
he can neither profit by his schooling nor refuse
his degree. Here we are in a world which
holds much pain and many pleasures, oceans of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
tears and echoes of laughter. Our position is
not without dignity, because we can endure;
and not without enjoyment, because we can be
merry. Gayety, to be sure, requires as much
courage as endurance; but without courage the
battle of life is lost. “To reckon dangers too
curiously, to hearken too intently for the threat
that runs through all the winning music of the
world, to hold back the hand from the rose because
of the thorn, and from life because of
death,—this is to be afraid of Pan.”</p>

</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">Fiction</span> is the only field in which women
started abreast with men, and have not lagged
far behind. Their success, though in no wise
brilliant, has been sufficiently assured to call
forth a vast deal of explanation from male
critics, who deem it necessary to offer reasons
for what is not out of reason, to elucidate
what can never be a mystery. Not very many
years ago a contributor to the “Westminster
Review” asserted seriously that “the greater
affectionateness” of women enabled them to
write stories, and that “the domestic experiences,
which form the bulk of their knowledge,
find an appropriate place in novels.
The very nature of fiction calls for that predominance
of sentiment which befits the feminine
mind.”</p>

<p>It is not easy, however, to account for Miss<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
Austen and Miss Brontë, for George Eliot
and George Sand, on the score of “affectionateness”
and domesticity. The quality of their
work has won for them and for their successors
the privilege of being judged by men’s
standards, and of being forever exempt from
that fatal word, “considering.” All that is
left of the half-gallant, half-condescending tone
with which critics indulgently praised “Evelina”
is a well-defined and clearly expressed
sentiment in favour of women’s heroines, and a
corresponding reluctance—on the part of men
at least—to tolerate their heroes. Mr. Henley
voiced the convictions of his sex when he
declared his readiness to accept, “with the
humility of ignorance, and something of the
learner’s gratitude,” all of George Eliot’s
women, “from Romola down to Mrs. Pullet”
(up to Mrs. Pullet, one would rather say),
and his lively mistrust of the “governesses in
revolt,” whom it has pleased her to call men.
Heroes of the divided skirt, every one of them,
was his verdict. Deronda, an incarnation of
woman’s rights. Tito, an improper female in
breeches. Silas Marner, a good, perplexed old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
maid. Lydgate alone has “aught of the true
male principle about him.”</p>

<p>This is a matter worthy of regard, because
the charm of a novel is based largely upon
the attraction its hero has for women, and its
heroine for men. Incident, dialogue, the development
of minor characters,—these things
have power to please; but the enduring triumph
of a story depends upon the depth of
our infatuation for somebody that figures in
it, and here, as elsewhere, the instinct of sex
reigns supreme. Why is it impossible for a
man, who is not an artist or an art-critic, to
acknowledge that the great portraits of the
world are men’s portraits? Because he has
given his heart to Mona Lisa, or to Rembrandt’s
Saskia, or to some other beauty, dead and gone.
Why do we find in the Roman Catholic Church
that it is invariably a man who expounds the
glory of Saint Theresa, and a woman who
piously supplicates Saint Anthony? The same
rule holds good in fiction. Clarissa Harlowe has
been loved as ardently as Helen of Troy. Mr.
Saintsbury gives charming expression to this
truth in his preface to “Pride and Prejudice.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span></p>

<p>“In the novels of the last hundred years,”
he says, “there are vast numbers of young
ladies with whom it might be a pleasure to fall
in love; there are at least five with whom, as
it seems to me, no man of taste and spirit can
help doing so. Their names are, in chronological
order, Elizabeth Bennet, Diana Vernon,
Argemone Lavington, Beatrix Esmond, and
Barbara Grant. I should have been most in
love with Beatrix and Argemone; I should, I
think, for mere occasional companionship, have
preferred Diana and Barbara Grant. But to
live with and to marry, I do not know that
any one of the four can come into competition
with Elizabeth.”</p>

<p>This choice little literary seraglio is by no
means the only one selected with infinite care
by critics too large-minded for monogamy,
while passions more exclusive burn with intenser
flame. Of Beatrix Esmond it might be
said that Thackeray was the only man who
never succumbed to her charms. Women have
been less wont to confess their infatuations,—perhaps
for lack of opportunity,—but they
have cherished in their hearts a long succession<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
of fictitious heroes, most of them eminently unworthy
of regard. We know how they puzzled
and distressed poor Richardson by their preference
for that unpardonable villain, Lovelace,
whom honest men loathe. Even in these chill
and seemly days they seek some semblance of
brutality. The noble, self-abnegating hero has
little chance with them. The perplexed hero
has even less. It is a significant circumstance
that, of all the characters upon whom Mrs.
Humphry Ward has lavished her careful art,
Helbeck of Bannisdale, who doesn’t know the
meaning of perplexity, and who has no weak
tolerance for other people’s views, makes the
sharpest appeal to feminine taste. But masculine
taste rejects him.</p>

<p>Rejects him, not more sharply, perhaps,
than it is wont to reject any type of manhood
put forward urgently by a woman. There was
a time when Rochester was much in vogue, and
girls young enough to cherish illusions wove
them radiantly around that masterful lover
who wooed in the fashion of the Conqueror.
But men looked ever askance upon his volcanic
energies and emotions. They failed to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
see any charm in his rudeness, and they resented
his lack of <i lang="fr">retenue</i>. Robust candour is
a quality which civilization—working in the
interests of both sexes—has wisely thought
fit to discard. Even Mr. Birrell, who is disposed
to leniency where Charlotte Brontë’s art
is concerned, admits that while Rochester is
undeniably masculine, and not a governess in
revolt, he is yet “man described by woman,”
studied from the outside by one who could only
surmise. And of the fierce and adorable little
professor, the “sallow tiger” who is the crowning
achievement of “Villette,” he has still
more serious doubts. “Some good critics there
are who stick to it that in his heart of hearts
Paul Emanuel was a woman.”</p>

<p>Does this mean that femininity, backed by
genius, cannot grasp the impalpable something
which is the soul and essence of masculinity?
Because then it follows that masculinity, backed
by genius, cannot grasp the impalpable something
which is the soul and essence of femininity.
Such a limitation has never yet been
recognized and deplored. On the contrary,
there are novelists, like Mr. Hardy, and Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
George Meredith, and Mr. Henry James, who
are considered to know a great deal more
about women than women know about themselves,
and to be able to give the sex some
valuable points for its own enlightenment.
Just as Luini and Leonardo da Vinci are believed
to have grasped the subtleties hidden
deep in the female heart, and to have betrayed
them upon their imperishable canvases in a
lurking smile or a gleam from half-shut eyes,
so Mr. Meredith and Mr. James are believed
to have betrayed these feminine secrets in the
ruthless pages of their novels. Mr. Boyesen,
for example, did not hesitate to say that no
woman could have drawn a character like
Diana of the Crossways, and endowed her with
“that nameless charm,” because “the sentiment
that feels and perceives it is wholly
masculine.” Why should not this rule work
both ways, and a nameless charm be given to
some complex and veracious hero, because the
sentiment that feels and perceives it is wholly
feminine? Mrs. Humphry Ward strove for
just such a triumph in her portrait of Edward
Manisty, but she strove in vain. Yet if the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
attraction of one sex for the other be mutual,
why should it enlighten the man and confuse
the woman? Or is this enlightenment less penetrating
than it appears? Perhaps a rare perfection
in recognizing and reproducing detail
may be mistaken for a firm grasp upon the
whole.</p>

<p>Certain it is that if men have looked with
skepticism at the types of manhood presented
with so much ardour by female novelists,—if
they have voted Rochester a brute, and Mr.
Knightley a prig, and Robert Elsmere a bore,
and Deronda “an intolerable kind of Grandison,”—women
in their turn have evinced
resentment, or at least impatience, at the attitude
of heroines so sweetly glorified by men.
Lady Castlewood is a notable example. How
kindly Thackeray—who is not always kind—treats
this “tender matron,” this “fair mistress”
of the admirable Esmond! What pleasant
adjectives, “gentlest,” “truest,” “loveliest,”
he has ever ready at her service! How
frankly he forgives faults more endearing
than virtues to the masculine mind! “It takes
a man,” we are told, “to forgive Lady Castlewood.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
She is the finest and most reverent
incarnation of what men conceive to be purely
feminine traits. In a world that belongs to its
masters, she is an exquisite appurtenance, a
possession justly prized. In a world shared—albeit
somewhat unevenly—by men and
women, she seems less good and gracious.
“I always said I was alone,” cries Beatrix
sternly. “You were jealous of me from the
time I sat on my father’s knee.” And the
child’s eyes saw the truth.</p>

<p>It has been claimed, and perhaps with justice,
that the irritation provoked by Thackeray’s
virtuous heroines is born of wounded vanity.
Mr. Lang observes that women easily pardon
Becky Sharp and Blanche Amory, but never
Amelia Sedley nor Laura Pendennis. For the
matter of that, men easily pardon Mr. Collins
and Mr. Elton. They do more than pardon,
they delight in these incomparable clerics, and
they adore Miss Austen for having created
them. Mr. Saintsbury vows that Mr. Collins
is worthy of Fielding or Swift. But their sentiments
towards the excellent Edmund Bertram,
who is all that a parson should be, are not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
wholly unlike the sentiments of women towards
Amelia Sedley, who is all that a wife and a
mother should be; nor are they ready to admit
that Mr. Darcy and Mr. Knightley are worthy
of Elizabeth and Emma. Lord Brabourne has
recorded a distinct prejudice against Mr.
Knightley, on the ground that he interferes too
much; yet it is plain that Miss Austen considered
this interference as a masculine prerogative,
exercised with judgment and discretion.
He is what women call “a thorough man,” just
as Amelia is what men call “a thorough woman.”
Mr. Lang bravely confesses his affection
for her on this very score: “She is such a
thorough woman.” It evidently does not occur
to him to doubt Thackeray’s knowledge, or
his own knowledge, of the sex.</p>

<p>Around Fielding’s heroines the battle has
raged for years. These kind-hearted, sweet-tempered
creatures have been very charming
in men’s eyes. Scott loved Sophia Western as
if she had been his own daughter,—he would
have treated her differently,—and took especial
pleasure in her music, in the way she
soothed her father to sleep after dinner with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
“Saint George, he is for England.” Sir Walter
and Squire Western had a stirring taste in
songs. Dr. Johnson gave his allegiance without
reserve to Fielding’s Amelia. He read the inordinately
long novel which bears her name at
a single sitting, and he always honoured her as
the best and loveliest of her sex,—this, too, at
a time when Clarissa held the hearts of Christendom
in her keeping. Amelia Booth, like
Amelia Sedley, is a “thorough woman;” that
is, she embodies all the characteristics which
the straightforward vice of the eighteenth century
conceived to be virtues in her sex, and
which provoke the envious admiration of our
own less candid age. “Fair, and kind, and
good,” so runs the verdict. “What more can
be desired?” And the impatient retort of the
feminine reader, “No more, but possibly a little
less,” offends the critic’s ear. “Where can you
find among the genteel writers of this age,” asks
Mr. Lang hotly, “a figure more beautiful, tender,
devoted, and, in all good ways, womanly,
than Sophia Western?” “The adorable Sophia,”
Mr. Austin Dobson calls her,—“pure
and womanly, in spite of her unfavourable surroundings.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
Womanliness is the one trait about
which they are all cock-sure. It is the question
at issue, and cannot be lightly begged. But
Sophia’s strongest plea is the love Sir Walter
gave her.</p>

<p>For Scott, though most of his young heroines
are drawn in a perfunctory and indifferent fashion—mere
incentives to enterprise or rewards
of valour—knew something of the quicksands
beyond. He made little boast of this knowledge,
frankly preferring the ways of men,
about whom there was plenty to be told, and
whose motives never needed a too assiduous analysis.
Mr. Ruskin, it is true, pronounced all
the women of the Waverley Novels to be finer
than the men; but he was arguing on purely
ethical grounds. He liked the women better
because they <em>were</em> better, not because their
goodness was truer to life. He was incapable
of judging any work, literary or artistic, by
purely critical standards. He had praise for
Rose Bradwardine, and Catherine Seyton, and
Alice Lee, because they are such well-behaved
young ladies; he excluded from his list of heroines
Lucy Ashton, who stands forever as a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
proof of her author’s power to probe a woman’s
soul. Scott did not care to do this thing. The
experiment was too painful for his hands. But
critics who talk about the subtleties of modern
novelists, as compared with Sir Walter’s
“frank simplicity,”—patronizing phrase!—have
forgotten “The Bride of Lammermoor.”
There is nothing more artistic within the whole
range of fiction than our introduction to Lucy
Ashton, when the doomed girl—as yet unseen—is
heard singing those curious and haunting
lines which reveal to us at once the struggle
that awaits her, and her helplessness to meet
and conquer fate.</p>

<p>There are fashions in novel-writing, as in
all things else, and a determined effort to be
analytic is imposing enough to mislead. We
usually detect this effort when men are writing
of women, and when women are writing
of men. The former seek to be subtle; the
latter seek to be strong. Both are determined
to reveal something which is not always
a recognizable revelation. In the earlier “novels
of character” there is none of this delicate
surgery. Fielding took his material as he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
found it, and so did Miss Austen. She painted
her portraits with absolute truthfulness, but
she never struggled for insight; above all she
never struggled for insight into masculinity.
She knew her men as well as any author needs
to know them; but her moments of illumination,
of absolute intimacy, were for women. It
is in such a moment that Emma Woodhouse
realizes, “with the speed of an arrow,” that Mr.
Knightley must marry no one but herself.</p>

<p>There is nothing “subtle” in this; nothing
that at all resembles Mr. Hardy’s careful explorations
into the intricacies of a character
like Eustacia Vye, in “The Return of the Native.”
There is nothing of Mr. James’s artfulness,
nothing of Mr. Meredith’s daring. These
two eminent novelists are past masters of their
craft. They present their heroines as interesting
puzzles to which they alone hold the key.
They keep us in a state of suspense from chapter
to chapter, and they too often baffle our
curiosity in the end. The treatment of Miriam
Rooth, in “The Tragic Muse,” is a triumph
of ingenuity. “What do you think of her?”
“What can you make out of her?” “What<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
is she now, and what is she going to be?” are
the unasked, and certainly unanswerable, questions
suggested by every phase of this young
woman’s development. The bewildered reader,
unable to formulate a theory, unable to make
even a feeble conjecture, is much impressed
by the problem laid before him, and by the
acuteness of the author who deciphers it. If
to evolve a sphinx and to answer her riddle is
to interpret femininity, then there are modern
novelists who have entered upon their kingdom.
But one remembers Rochefoucauld’s wise
words: “The greatest mistake of penetration
is, not to have fallen short, but to have gone
too far.”</p>

They fought bitter and regular, like man and wife.
</p>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">Since</span> the days of Richardson and Fielding,
English novelists have devoted themselves with
tireless energy to the pleasant task of match-making.
They have held this duty to be of
such paramount importance that much of their
work has practically no other <i lang="fr">raison d’être</i>.
They write their stories—so far as we can
see—solely and entirely that they may bring
two wavering young people to the altar; and
they leave <em>us</em> stranded at the church doors in
lamentable ignorance of all that is to follow.
Thackeray once asked Alexandre Dumas why
he did not take up the real history of other
people’s heroes and heroines, and tell the
world what their married lives were like.</p>

<p>It would have been a perilous enterprise,
for, notwithstanding two centuries of practice,
novelists are astonishingly bad match-makers.
We know what happened when Thackeray<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
himself undertook to continue the tale of
Ivanhoe and Rowena, whom Scott abandoned
to their fate, with merely a gentle hint of some
mental deviations on the bridegroom’s part.
Sir Walter, indeed, always shook hands with
his young couples on their wedding-day, and
left them to pull through as best they could.
Their courtships and their marriages interested
him less than other things he wanted to
write about,—sieges and tournaments, criminal
trials, and sour Scottish saints. He had
lived his own life bravely and happily without
his heart’s desire; he believed that it was the
fate of most men to do the same; and he clung
stoutly to Dryden’s <span class="locked">axiom:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Secrets of marriage still are sacred held,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Their sweet and bitter from the world concealed.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In real life this admirable reticence is a
thing of the past; but the novelist, for the
most part, holds his peace, leaving his readers
a prey to melancholy doubts and misgivings.</p>

<p>The English-speaking novelist only. In
French fiction, as Mr. Lang points out, “love
comes after marriage punctually enough, but
it is always love for another.” The inevitableness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
of the issue startles and dismays an English
reader, accustomed to yawn gently over
the innocent prenuptial dallyings of Saxon
man and maid. The French story-writer cannot
and does not ignore his social code which
urbanely limits courtship. When he describes
a girl’s dawning sentiment, he does so often
with exquisite grace and delicacy; but he reserves
his portrayal of the master passion
until maturity gives it strength, and circumstances
render it unlawful. His conception of
his art imposes no scruple which can impede
analysis. If an English novelist ventures to
treat of illicit love, the impression he gives is
of a blind, almost mechanical force, operating
against rather than in unison with natural
laws. Those normal but most repellent aspects
of the case, which the Frenchman treats
openly and exhaustively, the Englishman ignores
or rejects. His theory of civilization is
built up largely—and wisely—on suppression.</p>

<p>But why should the sentiment or passion
of love be the chosen theme of story-writers,
to the practical exclusion of other interests?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
Why should it be the central point around
which their tales revolve? When we look
about us in the world we know, we cannot
think that love is taking up much time and
attention in people’s lives. It dominates gloriously
for a brief period,—or for brief periods,—and
then makes way for other engrossing
influences. Its might and authority are recognized;
but the recognition does not imply
constant concern. The atmosphere of life is
not surcharged with emotion, as is the atmosphere
of fiction. Society is not composed of
young men and women falling madly but virtuously
in love with one another, nor of married
men and women doing the same thing on
less legitimate lines.</p>

<p>To these rational arguments, which have
been urged by restless critics before now, M.
Paul Bourget makes answer that novelists
deal with love because, under its white heat,
all characteristics become more vividly alive,
and are brought more actively and more
luminously into play. Man is never so self-revealing
as when consumed by passion. We
see into his heart, only when it is lit by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
flame of desire. Moreover, love being natural,
and in a manner inevitable, there is not in
treating of it that suggestion of artifice which
chills our faith in most of the incidents of
fiction.</p>

<p>But is the man whom we see revealed
by the light of love the real man? Can we,
after this transient illumination, say safely to
ourselves, “We know him well”? Is it his
true and human self, <i lang="fr">son naturel</i>, to use an
admirable old French phrase, which is both
quickened and betrayed by passion? Putting
cynicism aside, rejecting Lord Bacon’s dictum,
“Love is a nuisance, and an impediment to
important action,” we are still doubtful as to
the value of traits studied under these powerful
but perishable conditions. It is not what a
man does when he is in love, but what he does
when he is out of love (Philip drunk to Philip
sober) which counts for characterization. That
pleasant old romancer, Maistro Rusticiano di
Pisa, tells us that a courtier once asked Charlemagne
whether he held King Meliadus or
his son Tristan to be the better man. To this
question the Emperor made wise reply: “King<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
Meliadus was the better man, and I will tell
you why. As far as I can see, everything that
Tristan did was done for love, and his great
feats would never have been done, save under
the constraint of love, which was his spur and
goad. Now this same thing can never be said
of King Meliadus. For what deeds he did, he
did them, not by dint of love, but by dint of
his strong right arm. Purely out of his own
goodness he did good, and not by constraint
of love.”</p>

<p>It is this element of coercion which gives us
pause. Not out of his own goodness, nor out
of his own badness, does the lover act; but
goaded onward by a force too impetuous for
resistance. When this force is spent, then we
can test the might of his “strong right arm.”
Who that has read it can forget the matchless
paragraph of adjectives in which the Ettrick
Shepherd contrasts the glowing deceits of
courtship with the sober sincerities of married
life? “Love,” he sighs, “is a saft, sweet,
bright, balmy, triumphant, and glorious lie, in
place of which nature offers us in mockery
during a’ the rest o’ our lives the puir, paltry,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
pitiful, faded, fushionless, cauldrified, and chittering
substitute, truth.”</p>

<p>Small wonder that novelists content themselves
with making matches, and refrain from
examining too closely the result of their handiwork.
They would have more conscience about
it, if it were not so easy for them to withdraw.
They are almost as irresponsible as poets, who
delight in yoking unequal mates, as proof of
the power of love. Poetry weds King Cophetua
to the beggar maid, and smilingly retires from
any further contemplation of the catastrophe.
Shakespeare gives Celia—Celia, with her
sweet brown beauty, her true heart, her nimble
wit, her grace of exquisite companionship—to
that unnatural sinner, Oliver; and
the only excuse he offers is that Oliver says
he is sorry for his sins. So I suppose Helen
of Troy said she regretted her indiscretion,
and this facile repentance reinstated her in
happy domesticity. But the novelist is not at
play in the Forest of Arden. He is presumably
grappling with the dismal realities of earth.
Nothing could be less like a fairy playground
than the village of Thrums (“If the Auld-Licht<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
parishioners ever get to heaven,” said
Dr. Chalmers, “they will live on the north
side of it”); yet it is in Thrums that Mr.
Barrie marries Babbie to the Little Minister,—marries
her with a smile and a blessing, as
though he had solved, rather than complicated,
the mysterious problem of life.</p>

<p>The occasional and deliberate effort of the
novelist to arrange an unhappy union in order
to emphasize contrasts of character is an
advance toward realism; but the temporary
nature of such tragedies (which is well understood)
robs the situation of its power. In the
typical instance of Dorothea Brooke and Mr.
Casaubon, George Eliot deemed it necessary
to offer careful explanation of her conduct,—or
of Dorothea’s,—and she rather ungenerously
threw the blame upon Middlemarch society,
which was guiltless before high Heaven,
and upon the then prevalent “modes of education,
which made a woman’s knowledge another
name for motley ignorance.” In reality,
Dorothea was alone responsible; and it
is hard not to sympathize with Mr. Casaubon,
who was digging contentedly enough in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
little dry mythological dust-heaps when she
dazzled him into matrimony. It is hard for
the unregenerate heart not to sympathize occasionally
with Rosamond Vincy and with Tito
Melema, whom George Eliot married to Lydgate
and to Romola, in order that she might
with more efficacy heap shame and scorn upon
their heads. The moral in all these cases is
pointed as unwaveringly as the compass needle
points to the North Star. This is what happens
when noble and ignoble natures are linked
together. This is what happens when the sons
of God wed with the daughters of men. We
are not to suppose that it was poor Mr. Casaubon’s
failure to write his “Key to all Mythologies,”
nor even his ignorance of German, which
alienated his wife’s affection; but rather his
selfish determination to sacrifice her youth and
strength on the altar of his vanity,—a vanity
to which her early homage, be it remembered,
had given fresh impetus and life.</p>

<p>The pointing of morals is not, however, the
particular function of married life. The problem
it presents is a purely natural one, and
its ethical value is not so easily ascertained.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
For the most part the sons of men wed with
the daughters of men. They do not offer the
contrast of processional virtues and of deep
debasement; but the far wider contrast of
manhood and of womanhood, of human creatures
whose minds and hearts and tastes and
instincts are radically unlike; who differ in
all essentials from the very foundations of
their being. “Our idea of honour is not their
idea of honour,” says Mr. Lang, speaking for
men, and of women; “our notions of justice
and of humour are not their notions of justice
and of humour; nor can we at all discover a
common calculus of the relative importance of
things.”</p>

<p>This is precisely why we wish that novelists
would not neglect their opportunities, and
shirk their responsibilities, by escaping at the
church door. What did really happen when
Babbie married the little Minister, and added
to the ordinary difficulties of wedlock the extraordinary
complications of birth and training,
habits and character, irreconcilably at variance
with the traditions of the Auld-Licht rectory?
We know how the mother of John Wesley,—and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
incidentally of eighteen other children,—a
dour, stern, pious parson’s wife, refused to
say amen to her husband’s prayer for King
William, and dwelt apart from her reverend
spouse and master for twelve long months,
rather than relinquish a sentiment of loyalty
for the rightful sovereign of the land. Such
incidents stand in our way when we are told
musically <span class="locked">that—</span></p>

<p class="center">
Love will still be lord of all.
</p>

<p class="in0">Mrs. Wesley loved her husband, and she did
not love the banished and papistical James;
yet it was only King William’s death (a happy
and unforeseen solution of the difficulty) which
brought her back to submission and conjugal
joys.</p>

<p>For one of the most ill-assorted marriages
in fiction Miss Austen must be held to blame.
It was this lady’s firm conviction (founded on
Heaven knows what careful and continued
observation) that clever men are wont for the
most part to marry foolish or stupid women.
We see in nearly all her books the net results
of such seemingly inexplicable alliances. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
what moment of madness did Mr. Bennet ask
Mrs. Bennet to be his wife? Nothing can explain
such an enigma; but Miss Austen’s philosophy,
and her knowledge of that commonplace
middle-class English life, which the eighteenth
century had stripped bare of all superfluous
emotions, enabled her to prove—to her own
satisfaction at least—that Mr. Bennet was
tolerably content with the situation. It is not
too much to say that he enjoys his wife’s absurdities.
Only in his few earnest words to
Elizabeth, when Darcy has asked for her hand:
“My child, let me not have the grief of seeing
<em>you</em> unable to respect your partner in life,” do
we catch a glimpse of the Valley of Humiliation
which he has trodden for twenty-four years. A
still more emphatic illustration of Miss Austen’s
point of view is afforded us in “Sense and
Sensibility,” when Eleanor Dashwood decides
that Mrs. Palmer’s surpassing foolishness cannot
sufficiently account for Mr. Palmer’s rudeness
and discontent. “His temper might perhaps
be a little soured by finding, like many
others of his sex, that, through some unaccountable
bias in favour of beauty, he was the husband<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
of a very silly woman; but she knew that
this kind of blunder was too common for any
sensible man to be lastingly hurt by it.”</p>

<p>Fortified by such philosophy, convinced
that the natural order of things, though mysterious
and unpleasant, does not entail unhappiness,
Miss Austen deliberately marries Henry
Tilney to Catherine Morland; marries them
after an engagement long enough to have
opened the bridegroom’s eyes, were it not for
the seventy merciful miles which lie between
Northanger Abbey and the rectory of Fullerton.
With an acute and delicate cynicism, so gently
spoken that we hardly feel its sting, she proves
to us, in a succession of conversations, that “a
good-looking girl with an affectionate heart and
a very ignorant mind cannot fail of attracting
a clever young man, unless circumstances are
particularly untoward.” When Catherine delivers
her priceless views upon the unprofitable
labour of historians, we know that Mr. Tilney’s
fate is sealed.</p>

<p>“You are fond of history!—and so are Mr.
Allen and my father; and I have two brothers
who do not dislike it. So many instances within<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
my small circle of friends is remarkable. At
this rate, I shall not pity the writers of history
any longer. If people like to read their books,
it is all very well; but to be at so much trouble
in filling great volumes, which, as I used to
think, nobody would willingly ever look into,
to be labouring only for the torment of little
boys and girls, always struck me as a hard
fate. And though I know it is all very right
and necessary, I have often wondered at the
person’s courage that could sit down on purpose
to do it.”</p>

<p>To be told that history is made admirable
because you read it, is flattering indeed. Mr.
Tilney is satisfied that Catherine has “a great
deal of natural taste,”—an impression which
her artless admiration for his talents deepens
into agreeable certainty. When he asks her
hand in marriage, Miss Austen reminds us
with dispassionate candour that his attachment
originated in gratitude. “A persuasion of her
partiality for him had been the only cause of
his giving her a serious thought.” There is a
final jest about beginning “perfect happiness”
at the respective ages of twenty-six and eighteen,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
and the curtain is rung down upon a lifetime
of irrational ennui.</p>

<p>The world of the novelist is full of such
strange mishaps, and our sense of inquietude
corresponds with our conviction of their reality.
Mrs. Ward probably does not expect us to believe
that Jacob Delafield and Julie Le Breton
lived happily and harmoniously together. There
is something as radically inharmonious in their
marriage as in the union of conflicting elements.
It is not a question of taking chances of happiness,
as Sophia Western takes them with Tom
Jones (very good chances, to my way of thinking);
it is a question of unalterable laws by
which the gods limit our human joy. But there
is no sharp sense of disappointment awakened
in our hearts when we read “Lady Rose’s
Daughter,” as when more powerful currents
of emotion turn awry. That Henry Esmond
should have married Lady Castlewood, or rather,
that he should not have married Beatrix,
I count one of the permanent sorrows of life.</p>

<p>In an exceedingly clever and ruthlessly
disagreeable novel by Mr. Bernard Shaw,
“Cashel Byron’s Profession,” there is a brief,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
clear exposition of that precise phase of life
which novelists, as a rule, decline to elucidate.
Cashel Byron is a prize-fighter, a champion
light-weight, well-born (though he does not
know it) and of cleanly life; but nevertheless
a prize-fighter, with the instincts, habits, and
vocabulary of his class. A young woman, rich,
refined, bookish, brought up in a rarefied intellectual
atmosphere which has starved her
healthy sentiment to danger point, falls helplessly
in love with his beauty and his strength,
and marries him, in mute desperate defiance of
social laws. The story closes at this point, but
the author adds a brief commentary, designed
to explain the limited possibilities of happiness
that exist for the ex-pugilist and his wife.</p>

<p>“Cashel’s admiration for Lydia survived
the ardour of his first love for her, and she
employed all her forethought not to disappoint
his reliance on her judgment. She led a busy
life, and wrote some learned monographs, as
well as a work in which she denounced education
as practised in the universities and public
schools. Her children inherited her acuteness
and refinement, with their father’s robustness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
and aversion to study. They were precocious
and impudent, had no respect for Cashel, and
showed any they had for their mother principally
by running to her when they were in
difficulties.... The care of this troublesome
family had one advantage for her. It left her
little time to think about herself, or about the
fact that, when the illusion of her love passed
away, Cashel fell in her estimation. But the
children were a success, and she soon came to
regard him as one of them. When she had
leisure to consider the matter at all, which
seldom occurred, it seemed to her that, on the
whole, she had chosen wisely.”</p>

<p>Here are conditions which, if presented at
length and with sufficient skill, might hold us
spellbound. Here is an opportunity to force
conviction, were the novelist disposed to grapple
with his real work. As it is, Mr. Shaw
contents himself with adding one more to the
marital failures of fiction. Dr. Johnson said
that most marriages would turn out as well if
the Lord Chancellor made them. The Lord
Chancellor would assuredly make them better
than that blundering expert, the novelist.</p>

<div class="blockquot inhead">

<p>What pleasantness of teaching there is in books,—how
easy, how secret! How safely we lay bare the poverty of
human ignorance to books, without feeling any shame!
They are masters who instruct us without rod or ferule,
without angry words, without clothes or money. If you
come to them, they are not asleep; if you ask and inquire
of them, they do not withdraw themselves; they do not
chide if you make mistakes; they do not laugh at you if
you are ignorant. O books, who alone are liberal and free,
who give to all who ask of you, and enfranchise all who
serve you faithfully.—<span class="smcap">Richard de Bury</span>, Bishop of
Durham, <span class="smcap">A.&nbsp;D.</span> 1459.</p>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">Enough</span> has been written in praise of books
to fill a library. It is not always so eloquently
worded as is the Bishop of Durham’s benediction;
but the same general truths—or fallacies—are
repeated with more or less pride
and persuasiveness. At the same time, a lesser
library might be compiled of the warnings uttered
by the anxious ones who hold that the
power of books is more potent than benign,
and that if one half of the world’s readers are
being led gloriously to high and noble truths,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
the other half is being vitiated by an influence
which makes for paltriness and degradation.
Under all circumstances, we are asked to believe
that we are dominated by the printed
page. It is this conviction which induces so
much of austerity—not to say of censoriousness—in
our counsellors, whose upbraidings
are but the echoes of those sterner protests
with which church and state were wont in
earlier days to direct the reading courses of the
public. That books have always been deemed
formidable antagonists is proven by their frequent
condemnation. The fires that were kindled
for sorcerers and for heretics flamed just
as fiercely for the stubborn volumes which
passed the border-land of orthodoxy. Calvin
burned all the pamphlets and manuscripts of
Servetus at the same time that he burned their
author; in consequence of which thoroughness,
“Christianismi Restitutio” is said to be one
of the rarest dissertations in the world.</p>

<p>For some books that perished at the stake
the antiquarian can never mourn enough. An
act passed in the short reign of King Edward
VI commanded the wholesale destruction of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
all “antiphones, myssales, scrayles, processionales,
manuelles, legendes, pyes, prymars in
Lattyn or Inglishe, cowchers, journales, ordinales,
or other books or writings whatsoever,
heretofore used for the service of the churche,
written or prynted in the Inglishe or Lattyn
tongue.” Owners of these precious volumes
were commanded to give them up (heavy fines
being exacted for disobedience), that they
might be “openlye brent, or otherways defaced
and destroied.” None were spared, save the
“Prymars in the Inglishe or Lattyn tongue
set forthe by the late Kinge of famous memorie,
Kinge Henrie the eight;” and even from such
hallowed pages all “invocations or prayers to
saintes” were to be “blotted or clerelye put
out.” Orthodoxy is a costly indulgence. What
treasures were lost to the world, <span class="locked">what—</span></p>

<p class="center">
Small rare volumes, dark with tarnished gold,
</p>

<p class="in0">shrivelled into ashes, that the Book of Common
Prayer might rule in undisputed authority
and right!</p>

<p>Queen Elizabeth was strenuously opposed
to “schismatical” works, as well as to those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
of a political or diplomatic character. With
broad-minded impartiality she burned <em>all</em> books
and pamphlets which presumed to deal—no
matter in what spirit—with subjects she did
not wish discussed. Like the old Tory lady
who objected to her Tory butler’s sentiments,
seeing no reason why butlers should have
sentiments at all, Elizabeth punished the too
effusive piety and patriotism of her subjects
as severely as she punished their discontent.
The hall kitchen of the Stationers’ Company
witnessed many a bonfire of books during her
reign; and many an incautious author discovered
with poor Peter Wentworth that “the
anger of a Prince is as the roaring of a Lyon,
and even as the messenger of Death.” James
I favoured St. Paul’s churchyard as a spot singularly
suitable for the cremation of books;
and Oxford and Cambridge had their own exclusive
<i lang="fr">auto-da-fés</i> for two centuries and more.
Edinburgh, with fine national feeling, burned
Drake’s “Historia Anglo-Scotica,” because its
English tone offended Scottish pride; and England
burned the Rev. Arthur Bury’s “Naked
Gospel” in 1690, because she conceived that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
a rector of Exeter should veil his truths more
decently from the eyes of the feeble and profane.
The last book to achieve such unmerited
distinction in Great Britain was a copy of Mr.
Froude’s “Nemesis of Faith,” which, being
discovered in the possession of an Oxford student,
was publicly burned by the Rev. William
Sewell, Dean of Exeter, in the college hall, on
the twenty-seventh of February, 1849. “Oxford,”
says Mr. James Anson Farrer, “has
always tempered her love for learning with a
dislike for inquiry.” The incident, being at
best unusual, gave such a healthy impetus to
the sale of Mr. Froude’s work—which had
won no wide hearing—that it went into a second
edition, and became an object of keen,
though temporary, solicitude. Well might the
Marquis de Langle say that burning was as
a blue ribbon to any book, inspiring interest,
and insuring sales. There are those who
affirm that the “Index Expurgatorius,” by
which the Roman Catholic church still seeks
to restrain the reading of her children, is a
similar spur to curiosity. This I do not believe,
having never in my life met a Roman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
Catholic who knew what works were or were
not upon the “Index,” or who had been incautious
enough to inquire.</p>

<p>The decline of church discipline and the
enfeeblement of law permit books now to die
a natural death; but the conviction of their
powerful and perilous authority still lingers in
the teacher’s heart. If he knows, as is often
the case, much of letters and little of life, he
magnifies this authority until it seems the
dominant influence of the world. A writer in
one of the British quarterlies assures us with
almost incredible seriousness that we are at the
mercy of the authors whom we read.</p>

<p>“We take a silent, innocent-seeming volume
into our hands, and, when we put it down, we
shall never again be what we were before....
St. Augustine opened the book, and one single
sentence changed him from the brilliant, godless,
self-satisfied rhetorician into a powerful
religious force. Here, on the other hand, is a
youth who opens a mere magazine article written
against his faith. He throws off the early
influence of home like a mantle, and plunges
thenceforward into the ‘sunless gulf of doubt,’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
with the unspeakable morasses at the bottom.”</p>

<p>This is a little like the man who left the
Unitarian church because “somebody told
him it wasn’t true.” How is a soul so sensitive
to be kept in—or out of—any fold? A
religion which dissolves before the persuasions
of a magazine article must necessarily be as
short-lived as the love—“the slight, thin sort
of inclination”—which is starved, so Elizabeth
Bennett tells us, by a sonnet. “Ten
thousand difficulties,” says Cardinal Newman
nobly, “do not make one doubt;” but the
thinker who cannot surmount the first and
feeblest of the difficulties should never have
essayed the perilous pathway of the alphabet.
Neither was St. Augustine’s inspiration a flashlight
upon darkness. The “self-satisfied rhetorician”
was not converted, like Harlequin, in
one dazzling moment. There had been a long
and bitter struggle between the forces of life
and death, of the spirit and the flesh, before the
word of St. Paul penetrated with overwhelming
sweetness into a soul cleared by hard thinking,
and cleansed by a passion for perfection.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span></p>

<p>Man may be an unstable creature,—we
have been told so until we believe it,—but
he parts reluctantly from his convictions, and
is slow to break the habits of a lifetime.
Hear what Robert Burton has to say about
the obstinate perversity of heretics.</p>

<p>“Single out the most ignorant of them.
Convince his understanding. Show him his
errors. Prove to him the grossness and absurdities
of his sect. He will not be persuaded.”</p>

<p>He will not, indeed, whether persuasion
take the form of a sermon, a magazine article,
or the stake. Luther said that the more he
read the Fathers of the early Church, the
more he found himself offended; which proves
the strength of a mental attitude to resist the
most penetrating of influences. Neither are political
heretics any easier to enlighten. “Who,”
asks Lord Coleridge, “ever convinced an antagonist
by a speech?” On the contrary, there
is a natural and healthy sentiment of revolt
when views we do not share are set forth with
unbroken continuity and insistence. In the
give and take of conversation, in the advance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
and retreat of argument, in the swift intrusion
of the spoken word, made overpowering by the
charm of personality, we encounter a force too
subtle and personal to be resisted. Unconsciously
we yield at some point to the insidious
attack of thoughts and ideas so presented as to
weaken our individual opposition, and adroitly
force an entrance to our souls. But books,
like sermons, fail by reason of the smoothness
of their current; because there is no backwater
to stir the eddies, and whirl us into conflict and
submission. We feel that, could we have spent
our “mornings in Florence” with Mr. Ruskin,
have looked with him at frescoes, tombs, and
pavements, and have disputed at every point
his magnificent assumption of authority, we
might have ended by accepting his most unreasonable
and intolerant verdicts. Could we
free our souls by expressing to Mr. John Morley
our sentiments concerning Mr. Gladstone, we
might in return be impelled to share the enthusiasm
of the enlightened biographer. But
neither Mr. Buskin nor Mr. Morley has the
same power of persuasiveness in print. The
simple process of leaving out whatever is antagonistic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
makes demonstration easy, but inconclusive.
Sometimes the robust directness
of the method inclines us peremptorily to resistance.
It is hard for a generous heart not to
sympathize with the exiled Stewarts, after reading
Lord Macaulay’s “History of England.”
Mr. Froude must be held responsible for much
of the extravagant enthusiasm professed for
the Queen of Scots. And I once knew an intelligent
girl who had been driven by Mr. Prescott
into worshipping Philip II as a hero.</p>

<p>People who have contracted the habit of
writing books are naturally prone to exaggerate
their importance. It is this sentiment which
has provoked the attitude of fault-finding, of
continuous grumbling at readers, which is so
marked a characteristic of modern criticism.
The public is reproached, admonished, warned
by Mr. Frederic Harrison that if it feels contumacious—which
is not infrequently the case—it
should pray for a “cleanlier and quieter
spirit.” Whenever a handful of books is presented
to a community, addresses are made to
show, on the one hand, that reading and writing
are better than meat and drink, and, on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
other, that the people who read and write are
on the brink of abysmal destruction. I have
heard a lecturer upon one of these august occasions
gloomily prophesy that many of the
volumes waiting to be perused would “deprave
the taste, irritate the vanity, exaggerate the egotism,
and vitiate the curiosity of their readers.”
This seemed an unfortunate result for philanthropy
to achieve; but the speaker went on to
excite the godless interest of his audience by
warning them that romance—of which the
new library was reasonably full—would exercise
a “bewildering and blinding effect” upon
their minds, “filling them with false hopes and
enervating dreams.” He then defined a good
novel as one which should “stimulate a healthy
imagination, a sober ambition, a modest ardour,
an eager humility, a love of what is truly
great;” and left us oppressed with the conviction
that the usefulness of our earthly careers
and the salvation of our immortal souls depended
upon the fiction that we read.</p>

<p>“There is no harm,” says Mr. Birrell
sweetly, “in talking about books, still less in
reading them; but it is folly to pretend to worship<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
them.” It is folly to exaggerate their controlling
influence in our lives. We are not
more modestly ardent after reading “Vanity
Fair,” nor more eagerly humble after spending
long and happy hours with “Emma.” No sober
ambition stirs chastely in our souls when we lay
down, with a sigh of content, “Pride and Prejudice,”
or “Guy Mannering,” or “Henry Esmond,”
or “The Ordeal of Richard Feverel.”
Even “Anna Karénina” fails to inspire us with
“false hopes and enervating dreams;” and while
we are often bewildered by Mr. Henry James’s
masterpieces, we have never been blinded by
any. As for the ordinary novels that tumble
headlong from the press, it is impossible to imagine
them as inspiring either ardour or ambition,
egotism or humility. They may perhaps
be trusted to weaken our literary instincts, and
to induce mental inertia,—“the surest way of
having no thoughts of our own,” says Schopenhauer,
“is to take up a book every time we
have nothing to do,”—but they are not, as
their writers and their critics fearfully assert,
the arbiters of our destinies.</p>

<p>A belief in the overpowering influence of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
books was part of Carlyle’s gospel. He had a
curious modesty about giving advice, even when
it was sought; and—born dictator though he
was—he realized that his own literary needs
were not necessarily the literary needs of other
men. He said as much quite simply and sincerely
when people asked him what they should read,
holding always, with Dr. Johnson, that inclination
must prompt the choice. To be sure, like
Dr. Johnson, and like Emerson, he presupposed
inclination to be of an austere and seemly
order. Emerson never wearied of saying that
people should read what they liked; but he
plainly expected them to like only what was
good. Carlyle was firmly convinced that authorship
carried with it responsibilities too serious
for trifling. He reverenced the printed page,
and he expressed this reverence, this confession
of faith, in the most explicit and comprehensive
assertion.</p>

<p>“The writer of a book is he not a preacher,
preaching, not to this parish or that, but to
all men in all times and places? Not the
wretchedest circulating library novel which
foolish girls thumb and con in remote villages,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
but will help to regulate the actual practical
weddings and households of those foolish girls.”</p>

<p>More than this it would be impossible to
say, and few of us, I hope, would be willing
to say as much. The idea is too oppressive to
be borne. Only authors and critics can afford
to take this view of life. Personally I believe
that a foolish girl is more influenced by another
foolish girl, to say nothing of a foolish
boy, than by all the novels on the library
shelves. Companionship and propinquity are
forces to be reckoned with. Mind touches mind
like an electric current. The contagion of folly
is spread, like other forms of contagion, by
personal contact. Books may, as Carlyle says,
preach to all men, in all times and places;
but it is precisely their lack of reticence, the
universality of their message, their chill publicity
of tone which reduces their readers to the
level of an audience or of a congregation. If we
recall the disclosures with which we have been
favoured from time to time by distinguished
people who consented to tell the world what
books had influenced their lives, we cannot
fail to remember the perfunctory nature of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
these revelations. It was as though the speakers
had first marshalled in order the most enduring
masterpieces of literature, and had then
fitted their own sentiments and experiences
into appropriate grooves. This reversal of a
natural law is much in favour when what are
called epoch-making books come under public
discussion. There are enthusiasts who appear
to think that Rousseau evoked the French
Revolution, and that “Uncle Tom’s Cabin”
was responsible for the Civil War. When the
impetus of a profound and powerful emotion,
the mighty will of a great event finds expression
in literature,—or at least in letters,—the
writer’s mind speeds like a greyhound
along the track of public sentiment. It does
not create the sentiment, it does not appreciably
intensify it; but it enables people to perceive
more clearly the nature of the course
to which they stand committed. These sympathetic
triumphs are sometimes mistaken for
literary triumphs. They are often thought to
lead the chase they follow.</p>

<p>If, on the other hand, we ask ourselves
soberly what books have helped to mould our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
characters or to control our energies, we shall
not find the list an imposing one. There will
be little or nothing to tell a listening world.
Rather may we incline to the open skepticism
of Lord Byron: “Who was ever altered by a
poem?” Even presuming that we are happy
enough to detach ourselves from contemporary
criticism, and to read for human delight; even
presuming that, after a lifetime of effort, we
have learned to recognize perfection in literary
art, and to turn of our own free will to those
lonely works which “in the best and noblest
sense of a good and noble word, should be, and
forever remain, essentially unpopular;” even
then it does not follow that we are mastered
by the books we love. There still remains to
us that painful and unconquerable originality,
which is not defiant, but only helplessly incapable
of submission. “Giving a reason for
a thing,” says Dr. Johnson, “does not make it
right.” Let us hope that being unable to give
a reason for a thing does not prove us wrong.
The Rev. Mark Pattison, who was the most
unflinching reader of his day, who looked
upon money only as a substance convertible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
by some happy alchemy into leather-bound
volumes, and upon time only as a possession
which could be exchanged for a wider acquaintance
with literature, understood better
than any scholar in England the limitations
and futilities of print. He did not say with
Hobbes, “If I had read as much as other
men, I should doubtless have shared their
ignorance,” because he had read more than
other men, and was very widely informed; but
he pointed out with startling lucidity that a
flexible mind fortifies itself rather by conversation,
which is the gift of the few, than by
reading, which is the resource of the many.
“Books,” he said, “are written in response to
a demand for recreation by minds roused to
intelligence, but not to intellectual activity.”
There is something pathetic in his frankly envious
admiration of the French, who can and
do convey their thoughts to one another in
a language wrought up to be “the perfect
medium of wit and wisdom,—the wisdom of
the serpent,—the incisive medium of the practical
intelligence.” He quoted with melancholy
appreciation Lord Houghton’s story of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
Italian who, after submitting to the heavy hospitality
of an English country-house, drew a
newly arrived Frenchman into a corner with
the eager request: “<span lang="fr">Viens donc causer. Je n’ai
pas causé pour quinze jours</span>.”</p>

<p>Mr. Lang is responsible for the statement—spoken,
let us hope, in the enjoyment of a
sardonic mood rather than after dispassionate
observation—that the average Englishman or
Englishwoman would as soon think of buying
a boa-constrictor as buying a book. He or she
depends for intellectual sustenance upon that
happy lottery system which has been devised
by circulating libraries, and with which Americans
are so well acquainted,—a system which
enables us to put in a request for Darwin’s
“Origin of Species,” and draw out the Rev.
W. Profeit’s “Creation of Matter;” to put
in a request for “Lady Rose’s Daughter,” and
draw out “The Little Shepherd of Kingdom
Come.” It is evident that reading conducted
on this basis is as sure a path to cultivation
as a roulette table is to wealth. It has all the
charm of uncertainty, and all the value of
speculation. It eliminates selection, detaches<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
quantity from quality, and replaces the elusive
balancing of results by the unchallenged roll-call
of statistics. It expresses that unshaken
belief which is the gospel of the librarian,—namely,
that the number of books taken from
his shelves within a given time has something
to do with the educational efficiency of his
library.</p>

<p>Our power of self-deception—without which
we should shrivel into humility—is never so
comfortable nor so resourceful as in the matter
of reading. We are capable of believing, not
only that we love books which we do not love,
but that we have read books which we have
not read. A lifelong intimacy with their titles,
a partial acquaintance with modern criticism,
a lively recollection of many familiar quotations,—these
things come in time to be mistaken
for a knowledge of the books themselves.
Perhaps in youth it was our ambitious purpose
to storm certain bulwarks of literature, but we
were deterred by their unpardonable length.
It is a melancholy truth, which may as well
be acknowledged in the start, that many of
the books best worth reading are very, very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
long, and that they cannot, without mortal
hurt, be shortened. Nothing less than shipwreck
on a desert island in company with
Froissart’s “Chronicles” would give us leisure
to peruse this glorious narrative, and it is useless
to hope for such a happy combination of
chances. We might indeed be wrecked,—that
is always a possibility,—but the volume
saved dripping from the deep would be “Soldiers
of Fortune,” or “Mrs. Wiggs of the
Cabbage Patch.”</p>

<p>It is at least curious that if people love
books—as we are perpetually assured they
do—they should need so much persuasion to
read them. Societies are formed for mutual
encouragement and support in this engaging
but arduous pursuit. Optimistic counsellors
cheer a shrinking public to its task by recommending
minute quantities of intellectual nourishment
to be taken twenty-four hours apart.
They urge us to read something “solid” for
fifteen minutes a day, until we get used to it,
and they promise us that—mental invalids
though we be—we can assimilate great masterpieces
in doses so homœopathic that we need<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
hardly know we are taking them. But this is
not the spirit in which we pursue other pleasures.
We do not make an earnest effort to
enjoy our friends by admitting one for fifteen
minutes’ conversation every morning. If we
like a thing at all, we are apt to like a good
deal of it; and if we are working <i lang="it">con amore</i>,
we are wont to work very hard. To turn to
books, as Jeremy Collier counsels us, when we
are weary alike of solitude and companionship,
to value them, as he did, because they help us
to forget “the crossness of men and things,”
is to pay a sincere, but not an ardent, tribute
to their worth. Even the Bishop of Durham
praised his library, which he truly loved, because
it soothed his unquiet soul. The friendly
volumes forbore, as he gratefully noted, either
to chide his errors or to mock at his ignorance;
and there were contemporaries—like
Petrarch—who affirmed that, for so ardent
a bibliophile, the good Bishop had no great
store of learning. His words echo pleasantly
through the centuries, breathing the secret of
quiet hours stolen from stormy times; and we
repeat them, wondering less at their eloquence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
than at their moderation. “O books, who
alone are liberal and free, who give to all who
ask of you, and enfranchise all who serve you
faithfully.”</p>

<p>Just Heaven! for what wise reasons hast thou ordered
it that beggary and urbanity, which are at such variance in
other countries, should find a way to be at unity in this?—<span class="smcap">Sterne.</span></p>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">A rich</span> American, with a kind heart and a
lively sense of humour, was heard to remark
as he crossed the Italian frontier, <i lang="fr">en route</i> for
Switzerland: “<em>Now</em>, if there be any one in the
length and breadth of Italy who has not yet
begged from me, this is his time to come forward.”</p>

<p>It was a genial invitation, betokening that
tolerance of mind rarely found in the travelling
Saxon, who is fortified against beggars, as
against many other foreign institutions, by a
petition-proof armour of finely welded principle
and prejudice. He disapproves of mendicancy
in general. He believes—or he says he believes—that
you wrong and degrade your fellow
men by giving them money. He has the
assurance of his guide-book that the corps of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
ragged veterans who mount guard over every
church door in Rome are unworthy of alms, being
themselves capitalists on no ignoble scale.
His irritation, when sore beset, is natural and
pardonable. His arguments are not easily answered.
He can be vaguely statistical,—real
figures are hard to come by in Italy,—he can be
earnestly philosophical, he can quote Mr. Augustus
Hare. In the end, he leaves you perplexed
in spirit and dull of heart, with sixpence
saved in your pocket, and the memory of
pinched old faces—which do not look at all
like the faces of capitalists at home—spoiling
your appetite for dinner.</p>

<p>This may be right, but it is a melancholy
attitude to adopt in a land where beggary
is an ancient and not dishonourable profession.
All art, all legend, all tradition, tell for
the beggar. The splendid background against
which he stands gives colour and dignity to
his part. We see him sheltered by St. Julian,—ah,
beautiful young beggar of the Pitti!—fed
by St. Elizabeth, clothed by St. Martin,
warmed by the fagots which St. Francesca
Romano gathered for him in the wintry woods.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
What heavenly blessings have followed the
charity shown to his needs! What evils have
followed thick and fast where he has been rejected!
I remember these things when I meet
his piteous face and outstretched palm to-day.
It is true that the Italian beggar almost always
takes a courteous, or even an impatient denial
in wonderfully good part; but, should he feel
disposed to be malevolent, I am not one to be
indifferent to his malevolence. I do not like to
hear a shaken old voice wish that I may die
unshriven. There are too many possibilities
involved.</p>

<p>Mr. Henry James is of the opinion (and one
envies him his ability to hold it) that “the
sum of Italian misery is, on the whole, less
than the sum of the Italian knowledge of life.
That people should thank you, with a smile of
enchanting sweetness, for the gift of twopence
is a proof certainly of an extreme and constant
destitution; but—keeping in mind the sweetness—it
is also a proof of a fortunate ability
not to be depressed by circumstances.” This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
is a comforting faith to foster, and more credible
than the theory of secreted wealth within
the beggar’s pouch. It takes a great many
pennies to build up a substantial fortune, and
the competition in mendicancy is too keen to
permit of the profits being large. The business,
like other roads to fortune, is “not
what it once was.” A particularly good post,
long held and undisputed, an imposingly venerable
and patriarchal appearance, a total absence
of legs or arms,—these things may lead
to modest competency; but these things are
rare equipments. My belief in the affluence
of beggars, a belief I was cherishing carefully
for the sake of my own peace of mind, received
a rude shock when I beheld a crippled
old woman, whose post was in the Piazza S.
Claudio, tucked into a doorway one cold December
midnight, her idle crutches lying on
her knees. If she had had a comfortable or
even an uncomfortable home to go to, why
should she have stayed to shiver and freeze in
the deserted Roman streets?</p>

<p>The latitude extended by the Italian Church
to beggars, the patronage shown them, never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
ceases to vex the tourist mind. An American
cannot reconcile himself to marching up the
church steps between two rows of mendicants,
each provided with a chair, a little <i lang="it">scaldino</i>,
and a tin cup, in which a penny rattles lustily.
There is nothing casual about the appearance
of these freeholders. They make no pretence—as
do beggars at home—of sudden emergency
or frustrated hopes. They are following
their daily avocation,—the only one for which
they are equipped,—and following it in a spirit
of acute and healthy rivalry. To give to one
and not to all is to arouse such a clamorous
wail that it seems, on the whole, less stony-hearted
to refuse altogether. Once inside the
sacred walls, we find a small and well-selected
body of practitioners hovering around the portals,
waiting to exact their tiny toll when we are
ready to depart. “Exact” is not too strong a
word to use, for I have had a lame but comely
young woman, dressed in decent black, with a
black veil framing her expressive face, hold the
door of the Aracœli firmly barred with one arm,
while she swept the other toward me in a gesture
so fine, so full of mingled entreaty and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
command, that it was worth double the fee
she asked. Occasionally—not often—an intrepid
beggar steals around during Mass, and,
touching each member of the congregation on
the shoulder, gently implores an alms. This is
a practice frowned upon as a rule, save in Sicily,
where a “plentiful poverty” doth so abide
that no device for moving compassion can be
too rigidly condemned. I have been present at
a high Mass in Palermo, when a ragged woman
with a baby in her arms moved slowly after
the sacristan, who was taking up the offertory
collection, and took up a second collection
of her own, quite as though she were
an authorized official. It was a scandalous
sight to Western eyes,—in our well-ordered
churches at home such a proceeding would be
as impossible as a trapeze performance in the
aisle,—but what depths of friendly tolerance
it displayed, what gentle, if inert, compassion
for the beggar’s desperate needs!</p>

<p>For in Italy, as in Spain, there is no gulf
set between the rich and poor. What these
lands lack in practical philanthropy is atoned
for by a sweet and universal friendliness of demeanour,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
and by a prompt recognition of rights.
It would be hard to find in England or in
America such tattered rags, such gaunt faces
and hungry eyes; but it would be impossible
to find in Italy or in Spain a church where
rags are relegated to some inconspicuous and
appropriate background. The Roman beggar
jostles—but jostles urbanely—the Roman
prince; the noblest and the lowliest kneel side
by side in the Cathedral of Seville. I have heard
much all my life about the spirit of equality,
and I have listened to fluent sermons, designed
to prove that Christians, impelled by supernatural
grace, love this equality with especial
fervour; but I have never seen its practical
workings, save in the churches of southern
Europe. There tired mothers hush their babies
to sleep, and wan children play at ease in their
Father’s house. There I have been privileged
to stand for hours, during long and beautiful
services, because the only available chairs had
been appropriated by forlorn creatures who
would not have been permitted to intrude into
the guarded pews at home.</p>

<p>It has been always thus. We have the evidence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
of writers who give it with reluctant
sincerity; of Borrow, for example, who firmly
believed he hated many things for which he
had a natural and visible affinity. “To the
honour of Spain be it spoken,” he writes in “The
Bible in Spain,” “that it is one of the few countries
in Europe where poverty is never insulted
nor looked upon with contempt. Even at an
inn the poor man is never spurned from the
door, and, if not harboured, is at least dismissed
with fair words, and consigned to the mercies
of God and His Mother.”</p>

<p>The more ribald Nash, writing centuries
earlier, finds no words too warm in which to
praise the charities of Catholic Rome. “The
bravest Ladies, in gownes of beaten gold,
washing pilgrims’ and poor soldiours’ feete....
This I must say to the shame of us English;
if good workes may merit Heaven, they doe
them, we talk about them.”</p>

<p>The Roman ladies “doe them” still; not
so picturesquely as they did three hundred
years ago, but in the same noble and delicate
spirit. Their means and their methods are far
below the means and methods of charitable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
organizations in England and America. They
cannot find work where there is no work to be
done. They cannot lift the hopeless burden of
want which is the inevitable portion of the
Italian poor. They can at best give only the
scanty loaf which keeps starvation from the
door. They cannot educate the children, nor
make the swarming populace of Rome “self-respecting,”
by which we mean self-supporting.
But they can and do respect the poverty they
alleviate. Their mental attitude is simpler than
ours. They know well that it is never the
wretchedly poor who “fear fate and cheat
nature,” and they see, with more equanimity
than we can muster, the ever recurring tragedy
of birth. The hope, so dear to our Western
hearts, of ultimately raising the whole standard
of humanity shines very dimly on their horizon;
but if they plan less for the race, they
draw closer to the individual. They would
probably, if questioned, say frankly with Sir
Thomas Browne: “I give no alms only to satisfy
the hunger of my Brother, but to fulfil
and accomplish the Will and Command of my
God.” And if the “Religio Medici” be somewhat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
out of date,—superseded, we are told,
by a finer altruism which rejects the system
of reward,—we may still remember Mr.
Pater’s half rueful admission that it was all
“pure profit” to its holder.</p>

<p>When Charles Lamb lamented, with innate
perversity, the decay of beggars, he merely
withdrew his mind from actualities,—which
always annoyed him,—and set it to contemplate
those more agreeable figures which were
not suffering under the disadvantage of existence.
It was the beggar of romance, of the
ballads, of the countryside, of the merry old
songs, whose departure he professed to regret.
The outcast of the London streets could not
have been—even in Lamb’s time—a desirable
feature. To-day we find him the most depressing
object in the civilized world; and the
fact that he is what is called, in the language
of the philanthropist, “unworthy,” makes him
no whit more cheerful of contemplation. The
ragged creature who rushes out of the darkness
to cover the wheel of your hansom with
his tattered sleeve manages to convey to your
mind a sense of degraded wretchedness, calculated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
to lessen the happiness of living. His
figure haunts you miserably, when you want
to forget him and be light of heart. By his
side, the venerable, white-bearded old humbugs
who lift the leather curtains of Roman
and Venetian churches stand forth as cheerful
embodiments of self-respecting mendicancy.
They, at least, are no pariahs, but recognized
features of the social system. They are the
Lord’s poor, whose prayers are fertile in blessings.
It is kind to drop a coin into the outstretched
hand, and to run the risk—not so
appalling as we seem to think—of its being
unworthily bestowed. “Rake not into the
bowels of unwelcome truth to save a half-penny;”
but remember, rather, the ever-ready
alms of Dr. Johnson, who pitied most those
who were least deserving of compassion. Little
doubt that he was often imposed upon. The
fallen women went on their way, sinning as
before. The “old struggler” probably spent
his hard-earned shilling for gin. The sick
beggar whom he carried on his back should
by rights have been languishing in the poorhouse.
But the human quality of his kindness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
made it a vital force, incapable of waste. It
warmed sad hearts in his unhappy time, as it
warms our sad hearts now. Like the human
kindness of St. Martin, it still remains—a
priceless heritage—to enrich us poor beggars
in sentiment to-day.</p>

<p>And this reminds me to ask—without hope
of answer—if the blessed St. Martin can be
held responsible for the number of beggars in
Tours? The town is not pinched and hunger-bitten
like the sombre old cities of Italy, but
possesses rather an air of comfort and gracious
prosperity. It is in the heart of a province
where cruel poverty is unknown, and where
“thrift and success present themselves as matters
of good taste.” Yet we cannot walk half
an hour in Tours without meeting a number of
highly respectable beggars, engrossed in their
professional duties. They do not sin against
the harmony of their surroundings by any
revolting demonstration of raggedness or penury.
On the contrary, they are always neat
and decent; and on Sundays have an aspect
of such unobtrusive well-being that one would
never suspect them of mendicancy. When a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
clean, comfortably dressed old gentleman, with
a broad straw hat, and a rosebud in his buttonhole,
crosses the street to affably ask an alms,
I own I am surprised, until I remember St.
Martin, who, fifteen hundred years ago, shared
his mantle with the beggar shivering by the
way. It was at Amiens that the incident occurred,
but the soldier saint became in time
the apostle and bishop of Tours; wherefore it
is in Tours, and not in Amiens, that beggars do
plentifully abound to-day; it is in Tours, and
not in Amiens, that the charming old tale moves
us to sympathy with their not very obvious
needs. They are an inheritance bequeathed us
by the saint. They are in strict accord with
the traditions of the place. I am told that giving
sous to old men at church doors is not a
practical form of benevolence; but neither was
it practical to cut a military cloak in two.
Something must be allowed to impulse, something
to the generous unreason of humanity.</p>

<p>And, after all, it is not begging, but only
the beggar who has forfeited favour with the
elect. We are begged from on an arrogantly
large scale all our lives, and we are at liberty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
to beg from others. It may be wrong to give
ten cents to a legless man at a street corner;
but it is right, and even praiseworthy, to send
ten tickets for some dismal entertainment to
our dearest friend, who must either purchase
the dreaded things or harass her friends in
turn. If we go to church, we are confronted
by a system of begging so complicated and so
resolute that all other demands sink into insignificance
by its side. Mr. John Richard Green,
the historian, was wont to maintain that the
begging friar of the pre-reform period, “who
at any rate had the honesty to sing for his supper,
and preach a merry sermon from the portable
pulpit he carried round,” had been far
outstripped by a “finer mendicant,” the begging
rector of to-day. A hospital nurse once
told me that she was often too tired to go to
church—when free—on Sundays. “But it
doesn’t matter whether I go or not,” she said
with serious simplicity, “because in our church
we have the envelope system.” When asked
what the system was which thus lifted church-going
from the number of Christian obligations,
she explained that envelopes marked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
with each Sunday’s date were distributed to the
congregation, and duly returned with a quarter
inclosed. When she stayed at home, she sent
the envelope to represent her. The collecting
of the quarters being the pivotal feature of the
Sunday’s service, her duty was fulfilled.</p>

<p>With this, and many similar recollections in
my mind, I own I am disposed to think leniently
of Italy’s church-door mendicants. How
moderate their demands, how disproportionate
their gratitude, how numberless their disappointments,
how unfailing their courtesy! I
can push back a leather curtain for myself, I
can ring a sacristan’s bell. But the patriarch
who relieves me of these duties has some dim,
mysterious right to stand in my way,—a right
I cannot fathom, but will not pretend to dispute.
He is, after all, a less insistent beggar
than are the official guardians of galleries and
museums, who relieve the unutterable weariness
of their idle days by following me from
room to room with exasperating explanations,
until I pay them to go away. I have heard
tourists protest harshly against the ever-recurring
obligation of giving pennies to the old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
men who, in Venice, draw their gondolas to
shore, and push them out again. They say—what
is perfectly true—that it is an extortion
to be compelled to pay for unasked and unnecessary
services, and they generally add something
about not minding the money. It is the
principle of the thing to which they are opposed.
But these picturesque accessories of
Venetian life are, for the most part, worn-out
gondoliers, whose days of activity are over, and
who are saved from starvation, only by the
semblance of service they perform. Their successors
connive at their pretence of usefulness,
knowing that some day they, too, must drop
their oars, and stand patiently waiting, hook in
hand, for the chance coin that is so grudgingly
bestowed. That it should be begrudged—even
on principle—seems strange to those whose
love for Venice precludes the possibility of
fault-finding. The graybeards sunning themselves
on the marble steps are as much a part
of the beautiful city as are the gondoliers silhouetted
against the sky, or the brown boys
paddling in the water. Such old age is meagre,
but not wholly forlorn. A little food keeps<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
body and soul together, and life yields sweetness
to the end. “It takes a great deal to
make a successful American,” confesses Mr.
James; “but to make a happy Venetian takes
only a handful of quick sensibility.... Not
the misery of Italians, but the way they elude
their misery, is what pleases the sentimental
tourist, who is gratified by the sight of a beautiful
race that lives by the aid of its imagination.”</p>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">The</span> spirit that animated the Crusader animated
the pilgrim. Piety, curiosity, the love
of God and the love of adventure, the natural
sentiment which makes one spot of ground more
hallowed than another,—a sentiment as old as
religion,—the natural restlessness of the human
heart,—a restlessness as old as humanity.
With the decay of the Crusades began the passion
for pilgrimages, which reached its height
in the fourteenth century, but which at a much
earlier period had begun to send men wandering
from land to land, and from sea to sea,
broadening their outlook, sharpening their intelligence,
uniting them in a common bond of
faith and sympathy, teaching them to observe
the virtues of hospitality, courtesy, and kindness.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
Much has been urged against the pilgrim,
even the genuine pilgrim; but it counts
for little when contrasted with his merits.
His was not the wisdom of Franklin. He
spent time, strength, and money with reckless
prodigality. He neglected duties near at
hand; he ran sharp risks of shipwreck, robbers,
and pestilence. But he was lifted, for a
time at least, out of the common round of life;
he aspired, however lamely, after spiritual
growth; and he assisted the slow progress of
civilization by breaking through the barriers
which divided nation from nation in the remoteness
of the Middle Ages.</p>

<p>The universality of a custom is pledge of
its worth. Pious Egyptians speeding along the
waterways to the temple of Bubastis; pious
Hindoos following from hermitage to hermitage
the footsteps of the exiled Rama; pious
Moslems making their painful journey to
Mecca; pious Christians turning their rapt
faces to Palestine,—from the dawn of history
to the present day we see the long procession
of pilgrims moving to and fro over the little
earth, linking shore to shore and century to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
century. Never without disaster, never without
privations, never without the echoes of disparagement,
never wholly discouraged nor
abashed, the procession winds brokenly along.
The pilgrims who visit Lourdes in this year
of grace are not mere victims of a spasmodic
enthusiasm. They are the inheritors of the
world’s traditions and of the world’s emotions.</p>

<p>Alexander, Bishop of Cappadocia, made a
pilgrimage to the Holy Land in the year 202.
He was by no means the first ecclesiastic to
undertake the journey, but the records that survive
from this period of limited authorship
are few and far between. It was not until a
century later that the Empress Helena stirred
the hearts of Christendom, and gave the impetus
that sent thousands of pilgrims to follow
the footsteps of the Redeemer. Many who
could not reach Palestine travelled as far as
Rome, to pray at the tombs of St. Peter and
St. Paul. From time to time the church
gently checked an enthusiasm which overstepped
the bounds of reason. Women, then
condemned to much staying at home, showed
an ardour for pilgrimage as natural as it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
disconcerting. Nuns joyously welcomed the opportunity
to leave, without broken vows, their
convent walls, and tread for a time the beaten
paths of earth. They found shelter on the
road in other houses of religion, where all such
devout wanderers were lodged and generously
entertained.</p>

<p>For the virtues which blossomed most fairly
along the pilgrim’s track were chivalry and hospitality.
For him a brotherhood of knights
guarded the robber-haunted forests of Germany.
For him the Spanish nobles kept watch
and ward over their mountain passes. For
him the galleys of St. John swept the Mediterranean
in search of Algerine pirates. For
him the Hospitalers built their first asylum.
For him rang out the Templar’s battle-cry,
“Beauceant! Beauceant!” as the dreaded banner
of black and white bore down into the fray.
The pilgrim paid no tithes nor tolls. Monasteries
opened to him their gates. In every
seaport, and in many a royal burgh, houses
were erected and maintained for his accommodation.
In Calais stood the old Maison Dieu,
with its wide, hospitable doors. Coventry was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
the first of English towns to provide a similar
shelter. These houses were either endowed
by pious benefactors or were supported by the
strong and wealthy guilds. In Lincoln, the
Guild of the Resurrection, founded in 1374,
had the following rule: “If any brother wishes
to make a pilgrimage to Rome, to Saint James
of Galicia, or to the Holy Land, he shall forewarn
the Guild; and all the members shall go
with him to the city gate, and each shall give
him at least a half-penny.” Other guilds lent
weightier service. Turn where we may, we see
on every side the animosities of nations softened
and the self-seeking of the human heart
subdued by the force of that <i lang="fr">esprit de corps</i>
which bound hard-fighting Christendom together.</p>

<p>Rivalry there was in plenty, as shrine after
shrine rose into fame and fortune. Palestine
lay far away, and the journey thither was beset
by difficulties and dangers. Rome held
the great relics which from earliest years had
drawn thousands of pilgrims to worship at her
altars. Spain came next in degree, with the
famous shrine of Compostella in Galicia, where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
lay the bones of her patron, St. James. So
popular was this pilgrimage that in the year
1434 no less than 2460 licenses were granted
in England to travellers bound for Compostella.
Cologne claimed the relics of the Magi;
France, the Holy Coat of Trèves, the shrine of
St. Martin of Tours, and the beautiful pilgrimage
churches of Boulogne and Rocamadour.
The last, fair still in its decay, was one of the
most celebrated in Europe. Great kings and
greater soldiers, Simon de Montfort among
them, had come as penitents to its rock-built
sanctuary; and so many English were counted
among its visitors that we find that arch-grumbler,
Piers Plowman, bitterly conjuring
his countrymen to stay away.</p>

<p>In good truth there were shrines in plenty
at home. Glastonbury, the resting-place of
Joseph of Arimathea, where grew the holy
thorn-tree; Bury Saint Edmunds, where all
might see the standard of the martyred king,
and where, to keep it company, Cœur de Lion
sent the captured banner of the king of Cyprus;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
Waltham, or Holy Cross Abbey, founded
by that devout and warlike Dane, Tovi, to
guard the mysterious cross of black marble, of
which none knew the history; Edward the Confessor’s
tomb at Westminster; Our Lady of
Walsingham, the best-loved church in England;
and the ever-famous shrine of St. Thomas à
Becket at Canterbury. “<span lang="la">Optimus aegrorum medicus
fit Thomas Bonorum</span>,” was the motto engraved
on the little pewter flasks brought back
by Canterbury pilgrims. “For good people
who are ill, Thomas is the best of physicians.”</p>

<p>Miracles apart, it was well to take the open
road, and to live for a few days, or for a few
weeks, in rain and sunshine. It was well to
escape the dreadful ministrations of doctors,
and trust to St. Thomas, who at all events
would not bleed and purge his patient’s life
away. It was well to quit the foulness of the
towns, to push aside the engrossing cares of
life, and to see the fair face of an English
summer.</p>

<p class="in0">Many a cure was wrought before the shrine
was gained, and a hopeful heart is ever a tonic
for body and soul together. The most constant
and the most curious reproach cast by reformers
at the pilgrims is that they were cheerful,
even merry, and that they went their way in
what seems to have been an irritating spirit
of enjoyment. One Master William Thorpe, a
sour and godly man, protested sternly in 1407
against the number of “men and women that
go on pilgrimages to Canterbury, to Beverley,
to Karlington, to Walsinghame, or to any such
other places”! His accusations were three in
number. The pilgrims spent “their goodes in
waste,”—which was true. They boasted, not
always truthfully, of what they had seen,—a
reprehensible habit of travellers since man
first roamed the earth. And, worst of all, they
sang, rang little bells,—the Canterbury bells,—and
made a joyous clatter on the road. To
this, Thomas Arundel, Archbishop of Canterbury,
deeming light hearts as near to grace as
sad ones, stoutly replied that pilgrims did well
to sing and be as cheerful as the hardships of
the way permitted. If a man’s foot were cut<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
and bleeding, it were better for him to sing
than to be silent, “for with soche solace the
travell and wearinesse of pylgremes is lightely
and merily broughte forthe.”</p>

<p>Not all pilgrimages, however, were undertaken
in this jocund spirit. Figures terrible
and tragic loom up in the darkness of history.
Fulk Nerra, the black Count of Anjou, driven
like Orestes by the stings of conscience, wandered
from shrine to shrine, seeking pardon
for nameless crimes. By his own command he
was dragged barefooted through the streets of
Jerusalem, his blood running down beneath the
pitiless strokes of the scourge. From Guyenne
to Picardy walked two noble Breton brothers,
their heavy chains eating into their flesh, their
heavier hearts burdened with unendurable remorse.
Even less sinful men were sometimes
inclined to penitence. The Lord of Joinville,
before setting forth with St. Louis on the
Seventh Crusade, walked in his shirt to every
shrine within twenty leagues of his castle, imploring
strength of arm and grace of soul. In
blither mood, the Viscount De Werchin, Seneschal
of Hainault, started upon a pilgrimage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
to St. James of Compostella. The journey was
long, and by way of diversifying it, the good
Seneschal despatched messengers announcing
his readiness to meet any knight, French, English,
or Spanish, who would engage with him in
a friendly passage of arms. That none who
coveted this distinction might be so unfortunate
as to lose it, he gave his itinerary with great
care, and even offered to turn aside from his
road as far as twenty leagues, for the felicity
of a little fighting. Surely St. James, the patron
of soldiers, who has himself turned the
tide of more than one hard-fought battle, must
have smiled kindly upon that brave and pious
pilgrim, when he knelt in his battered armour
before the glittering shrine.</p>

<p>Kings and princes frequently went upon
pilgrimages. The sprig of broom, the <i lang="la">planta
genistae</i>, destined to give its name to a great
and royal line, was worn by Geoffrey of Anjou—some
said in token of humility—when
he journeyed to the Holy Land. Henry the
Second of England travelled piously to Rocamadour,
and four English Edwards knelt in
turn at the feet of Our Lady of Walsingham.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
Jusserand tells us that the royal fee on such
occasions was seven shillings; the ordinances
of Edward the Second make especial mention
of the sum. It does not seem munificent, when
we remember that Canute took off his crown
and laid it on St. Edmund’s shrine; but
there were occasions when even seven shillings
were notably lacking. The Chronicles of Jocelin
of Brakelond, quoted by Carlyle in “Past
and Present,” relate minutely how King John
came to St. Edmundsbury with a large retinue,
how he gave the abbot thirteen pence,
beseeching in return a Mass, and presented to
the shrine a silken cloak, which was carried
promptly away by one of his followers, so that
the monks beheld it no more. When Henry
the Eighth and Catharine of Aragon visited
Walsingham, the king hung around the statue’s
neck a string of pearls and golden beads,
and perhaps was not unmoved subsequently by
a desire to have it back again.</p>

<p>“Of all our Ladyes, I love best our Lady
of Walsyngham,” says Sir Thomas More in one
of his “Dyalogues,” reflecting the common
sentiment of the past three hundred years, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
defending the ancient custom of pilgrimages
from the raillery of Erasmus. The road to
Walsingham, like the road to Canterbury, was
called the “Pilgrims’ Way;” the town was
full of inns and lodgings for the accommodation
of the devout, and “manye faire myracles”
were witnessed at the shrine. When the Norman
knight, Sir Raaf de Boitetourt, fled from
his burning castle, he sought refuge at Walsingham,
where for seven years he had kept
vigil on the eve of Epiphany. Hard pressed,
he reached the doors, and the Virgin, mindful
of faithful service, opened them with her own
hands, and drew him swiftly and gently within
her blessed walls.</p>

<p>Frequent mention is made of Walsingham
in state papers and in family chronicles. The
Paston letters contain numerous allusions to
this popular shrine. John Paston’s wife, troubled
by the news of her husband’s illness,
writes to him lovingly: “My mother behested
[vowed] another image of wax of the weight
of you to our Lady of Walsingham; and she
sent four nobles to the four orders of friars
at Norwich to pray for you; and I have behested<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
a pilgrimage to Walsingham and to St.
Leonards for you.” Again, Justice Yelverton
thanks John Paston, “especially for that ye do
much for our Lady’s house at Walsingham,
which I trust verily ye do the rather for the
great love that ye deem I have thereto; for
truly if I be drawn to any worship or welfare,
and discharge of mine enemies’ danger, I
ascribe it unto our Lady.”</p>

<p>In proportion to the piety of the pilgrim
flames the wrath of the reformer. Denunciations
from poets of a radical turn, like Langland
and Skelton, echo shrilly through English
letters.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class="in0">This sounds like the bitterness of the stay-at-home,
resenting with his whole soul the allurement
of travellers’ tales,—tales to which Chaucer
lent a tolerant ear. A century and a half
later, when reform had had its way, when the
relics of St. Thomas had been scattered to the
winds, when our Lady’s image had been flung<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
from its altar into the nearest well, and Cranmer
in his “Catechism” had alluded to vows
and pilgrimages as half-forgotten errors, one
poor faithful soul was accused in 1542 of going
to Walsingham,—not blithely, indeed, with
song and ringing of bells, but sad, fearful, and
forlorn, to pray at the defaced and empty
shrine.</p>

<p>There was a little chapel built on one of the
eastern piers of old London Bridge, and dedicated
to St. Thomas à Becket. Hither came
the pilgrims bound for Canterbury, or for the
far-off shrines of Compostella and Rocamadour,
to beg a blessing on their journey; and many
were the curious eyes that watched them faring
forth. To-day, when no spot is remote, and nothing
is unknown, it is hard to understand the
interest which once attached itself to the wanderer,
or to realize his importance as a link in
the human chain. At a time when the mass of
mankind learned orally what it learned at all,
when news crept slowly over the country-side,
and rumour passed from one village ale-house
to another, people were preserved from mental
stagnation by the “unwyse tales” which Langland<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
found so reprehensible. They heard how
a fair and famous courtesan, smitten with
blindness, travelled to Rocamadour, beseeching
a cure, and how, kneeling outside the
walls, she was withheld by an invisible power
from entering the sanctuary. Then, confessing
her sins with tears and lamentations, she
cut off her beautiful <span class="locked">hair,—</span></p>

</div>
</div>

<p class="in0">and offered it to the Virgin in token of amendment.
This being done, the barrier was lifted,
she hastened into the church, “giving praise
to the Mother of God,” and sight was restored
to her eyes.</p>

<p>Many were the miracles related by pilgrims,
and bewildering were the wonders they described.
The zeal for relics having far outrun
discretion, a vast hoard of heterogeneous and
apocryphal objects had been collected in every
church, and were reverenced indiscriminately
by the devout. They were less grisly, but
hardly less marvellous than the weapons which
Christian found in the house of Prudence,
Piety, and Charity, when these benevolent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
ladies exhibited to their guest the “engines
with which God’s servants had done wonderful
things.” Christian’s delight over the hammer
and nail with which Jael killed Sisera, the
sling and stone with which David killed Goliath,
the jaw bone of an ass with which Samson
killed the Philistines, and the ox goad with
which Shamgar killed six hundred of his enemies,
is but the reflection of a gentler sentiment
which stirred the pilgrim’s heart. Our
ancestors were not wont to reason very distinctly
on these or on other matters; the abnormal
offered no obstacle to their credulity;
and the complete absence of an historic background
annihilated for them a dozen and more
intervening centuries. The Holy Coat carried
them in spirit to Nazareth, the Veil of Veronica
led them to the foot of the Cross. When
told that the head of St. John the Baptist reposed
in a church at Amiens, they neither calculated
the probabilities of the case nor inquired
into ways and means. When a few far-travelled
pilgrims heard that the same relic was
claimed by a church in Constantinople, they
either became partisans—a natural sentiment—or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
argued with the simple sagacity of Sir
John Mandeville. Which was the true head he
could not tell. “I wot nere but God knowethe;
but in what wyse that men worschippen it, the
blessed seynte John holt him a-payd.”</p>

<p>This is the pith and marrow of the argument.
Pilgrims, reaching back dimly into a
shrouded past, grasped at the relic which bridged
for them the chasm, and felt the mysterious
blessedness of association. If it were not what
it was believed to be, the saints, well aware
both of men’s fallibility and of their good faith,
would undoubtedly “holt them a-payd.” The
same sentiment hallowed countless shrines, and
found expression in the <i lang="la">sygnys</i> or medals
which then, as now, played a prominent part
in pilgrimages. We know how little such customs
change when we read of the fourteenth-century
pilgrims at Rocamadour, and see the
twentieth-century pilgrims at Lourdes. The
Rocamadour medals were made of pewter,
stamped with an image of the Virgin, and
pierced with holes so that they could be sewn
to the cap or dress. The right to make and sell
them belonged exclusively to the family of De<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
Valon, and had been granted by the crown in
return for military service. So large were the
sales, and so comfortable the profits, that the
thrifty townspeople constantly infringed upon
the seignorial privilege, and flooded the market,
in defiance of all authority, with contraband
medals,—a pardonable offence, not without
parallel in every age and land.</p>

<p>The Canterbury <i lang="la">sygnys</i> were in the shape
of little flasks; at Compostella they were
minute cockle-shells; at Amiens they bore the
head of St. John the Baptist: “<span lang="la">Ecce signum
faciei beati Johannis Baptistae</span>.” So pleased
were pilgrims with these devices, and so proud
to wear the mementoes of their piety,—as
the Moslem, returned from Mecca, wears his
green turban,—that we find Erasmus mocking
at their appearance “clothyd with cockle-schelles,
and laden on every side with bunches
of lead and tynne.” There is not a shrine in
Europe to-day unprovided with similar tokens.
At Auray, medals of St. Anne; at Padua,
medals of St. Anthony; at Avila, medals of
St. Theresa; at Prague, medals of the Holy
Infant; at Loretto, medals of the Santa Casa;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
at Genazzana, medals of Our Lady of Good
Counsel; at Paray-le-Monial, medals of the
Sacred Heart; at the charming old pilgrimage
church of Maria Plain near Salzburg, medals
of the Blessed Virgin uncovering the Divine
Child; at Lourdes, more medals and rosaries
than one can imagine all Catholic Christendom
buying in the next three hundred years.</p>

<p>Yet bought they are, and could Erasmus
behold the pilgrims leaving Lourdes, he would
deem himself once more on the Walsingham
way. It is well to watch the French country
people, laden with the heavy baskets which
hold their supply of food, grasping the inevitable
umbrellas, as big and bulky as folded
tents, and burdened furthermore with an assortment
of pious souvenirs that require the utmost
care in handling. They move slowly in little
groups from image to image in the lower church.
Some scholar of the party spells out the name
of each saint, and then all softly rub their
miscellaneous treasures—beads, scapulars,
medals, <i lang="fr">bénitiers</i>—up and down the statue’s
robe and feet. Some old, old, misty notion of
the blessedness of touch dwells confusedly in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
every mind. Their contentment is beautiful to
behold. They alone know by what sacrifices and
privations these days of pilgrimage were made
possible; but we know how much they have
gained. New sensations; the sudden opening of
the world’s closed doors, revealing to them a
little corner amid wide mysterious spaces; the
stirring of the heart in the presence of sacred
things; one keen experience in a monotonously
bucolic life; one deep breath of a diviner air;
something desired, achieved, and ever to be remembered,—what
generous mind doubts that
all this is better than sensibly staying at home?
No observer could have stood at the doors of
St. Peter’s in the spring of 1900, when the
pilgrims of every land thronged up the sunlit
steps, without learning once for all the value of
emotions. The crowd stared, jostled, chattered,
as it swept along, and then, entering those vast,
harmonious aisles, fell silent, while there came
into every face a look that could never be
mistaken nor forgotten. It was the leaping of
the human soul to the ideal. It was an inarticulate
<i lang="la">nunc dimittis</i>, as the pilgrim entered
upon the inheritance of ages.</p>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">It</span> is well for us who are interested in colonial
days and colonial ways that their leisure
gave men and women ample opportunity to
keep diaries, and that a modesty now quite unknown
made them willing to spend long hours
in writing pages not destined for publication.
There is something very charming about this
old-fashioned, long-discarded reticence, this deliberate
withholding of trivial incidents and
fleeting impressions from the wide-mouthed curiosity
of the crowd. Even when the Revolution
had awakened that restless spirit of change
which scorned the sobriety of the past, there
lingered still in people’s hearts an inherited
instinct of reserve. Men breakfasted with
Washington, dined with John Adams, fought
by the side of La Fayette, and never dreamed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
of communicating these details to the world.
Women danced at the redcoat balls, or curtsied
and yawned at Mrs. Washington’s receptions,
and then went home and confided their experiences
either to their friends, in long, gossiping
letters, or to the secret pages of their diaries.
It was a lamentable waste of “copy,” but a
saving of dignity and self-respect.</p>

<p>As for the earlier, easier days, when the infant
colonies waxed fat on beef and ale, literary
aspirations had not then begun to afflict the
hearts of men. It is delightful to think how
well little Philadelphia, like New York, got
along without so much as a printing press,
when she had starved out her only printer,
Bradford,—a most troublesome and seditious
person,—and sent him over to little Boston,
which even then had more patience than her
neighbours with books. Yet all this time, honest
citizens were transcribing in letters and
in journals whatever was of daily interest
or importance to them; and it is by help of
these letters and these journals that we now
look back upon that placid past, and realize
the every-day existence of ordinary people,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
nearly two centuries ago. We know through
them, and through them only, what manner of
lives our forefathers led in Puritan New England,
in comfortable Dutch New York, in demure
Quaker Pennsylvania, before the sharp
individuality of each colony was merged into
the common tide, and with the birth of a nation—“a
respectable nation,” to use the words
of Washington, who was averse to glittering
superlatives—the old order passed away forever
from the land.</p>

<p>“It is to the pages of Judge Sewall’s diary,”
writes Alice Morse Earle, “that we must turn
for any definite or extended contemporary picture
of colonial life in New England;” just as
we turn for the corresponding picture of old
England to the diaries of John Evelyn and of
Mr. Samuel Pepys. Mrs. Earle does not add,
though she well might, that it is better discipline
to read Judge Sewall’s records than those
of all the other diarists in Christendom; for,
by contrast with the bleak cheerlessness of
those godly days, our own age seems flooded
with sunshine, and warm with the joy of life.
And not our own age only. If we pass from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
ice-bound Massachusetts to colonies less chilly
and austere, we step at once into a different
world, a tranquil and very comfortable world;
not intellectual nor anxiously religious, but
full of eating and drinking, and the mildest
of mild amusements, and general prosperity
and content. Even the Pennsylvania Quakers,
though not permitted to dally openly with
flaunting and conspicuous pleasures, with blue
ribbons, coloured waistcoats, or the shows of
itinerant mummers, enjoyed a fair share of
purely mundane delights. If Judge Sewall’s
journal tells us plainly and pitilessly the story
of Puritanism, what it really meant in those
early uncompromising days, what virtues it
nourished, what sadness it endured, the diary
of a Philadelphia Friend gives us a correspondingly
clear insight into that old-time Quakerism,
gentle, silent, tenacious, inflexible, which
is now little more than a tradition in the land,
yet which has left its impress forever upon the
city it founded and sustained.</p>

<p>Elizabeth Sandwith, better known as Elizabeth
Drinker,—though even that name has
an unfamiliar sound, save to her descendants<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
and to a few students of local history,—was
born in Philadelphia in 1735. She was the
daughter of wealthy Friends, and her education,
liberal for those days, would not be deemed
much amiss even in our own. It included a
fair knowledge of French and a very admirable
familiarity with English. She read books
that were worth the reading, and she wrote
with ease, conciseness, and subdued humour.
Her diary, begun in 1758, was continued without
interruption for forty-nine years. It is valuable,
not only as a human document, and as
a clear, graphic, unemotional narrative of the
most troubled and triumphant period in our
country’s history, but because it contains a
careful record of events which—of the utmost
importance to the local historian—may
be searched for in vain elsewhere. The entries
are for the most part brief, and to this brevity,
no doubt, we owe the persevering character of
the work. It is the enthusiasm with which the
young diarist usually sets about her task that
threatens its premature collapse. She begins
by being unduly confidential, and ends by having
nothing to confide.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span></p>

<p>Not so this Quaker girl, reticent even with
herself; avoiding, even in the secret pages of
her journal, all gossip about her own soul, all
spiritual outpourings, all the dear and inexhaustible
delights of egotism. She notes down,
indeed, every time she goes to meeting, and
also the date on which she begins to work
“a large worsted Bible cover,”—which Bible
cover is in the possession of her great-great-grandchildren
to-day; but neither the meetings
nor the worsted work betray her into a
complacent piety, and she is just as careful to
say when she has been drinking tea, or spending
the afternoon with any of her young
friends. As a matter of fact, tea-drinking and
kindred frivolities are evidently more to her
liking, though she will not confess it, than
serious and improving occupations. Philadelphia,
dazzled by Franklin’s discoveries, was
pleased to think herself scientific in those days;
and young men and women were in the habit
of attending learned lectures,—or what were
then thought learned lectures,—and pretending
they understood and enjoyed them,—a
mental attitude not wholly unfamiliar to us<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
now. So keen was the thirst for knowledge
that men paid four shillings for the privilege
of looking at a skeleton and some anatomical
models in the Pennsylvania Hospital. Our
Quaker Elizabeth, however, will have none of
these dreary pastimes. To electricity and to
skeletons she is alike indifferent; but she pays
two shillings cheerfully to see a lioness, exhibited
by some enterprising showman, and she
records without a scruple that she and her
family gave the really exorbitant sum of six
shillings and sixpence for a glimpse at a
strange creature which was carried about in
a barrel, and which its owner said was half
man and half beast, but which turned out to
be a young baboon, very sick and sad. “I
felt sorry for the poor thing, and wished it
back in its own country,” says the gentle-hearted
Quakeress, who has always a pitying
word for beasts.</p>

<p>The fidelity with which this delightful journal
is kept enables us to know what sober
diversions fell to the lot of strict Friends, to
whom the famous Philadelphia Dancing Assemblies
and the equally famous old Southwark<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
Theatre were alike forbidden joys; who
never witnessed the glories of the Mischianza,
nor the gay routs of the redcoat winter; who,
though loyal to the crown, shared in none
of the festivities of the king’s birthday; who
were too circumspect even to join the little
group of Quaker ladies for whom M. de Luzerne
prepared a separate apartment at the
beautiful <i lang="fr">fête du Dauphin</i>, and who, wistful
and invisible, watched through a gauze curtain
the brilliant scene in which they had no share.</p>

<p>None of these dallyings with the world, the
flesh, and the devil, no glimpses into the fast-growing
dissipation of the gayest and most extravagant
city in the colonies, find a record in
Elizabeth Drinker’s diary. Her utmost limit
of frivolity is reached in a sleighing party on
a winter afternoon; in tea-drinking on winter
evenings; in listening to a wonderful musical
clock, which cost a thousand guineas in Europe
and played twenty tunes; and in gazing at a
panorama of London, which most Philadelphians
considered almost as good as visiting
the metropolis itself. When she is well advanced
in years, she is beguiled by her insatiable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
curiosity into going to see an elephant,
which is kept in a “small ordinary room,” in a
not very reputable alley. In fact, she is a little
frightened, and more than a little ashamed,
at finding herself in such a place, until she
encounters a friend, Abigail Griffitts, who has
come to gratify <em>her</em> curiosity under pretence of
showing the elephant to her grandchildren; and
the two women are so sustained by each other’s
company that they forget their confusion, and
proceed to examine the mammoth together.
“It is an innocent, good-natured, ugly Beast,”
comments Elizabeth Drinker, “which I need
not undertake to describe; only to say it is
indeed a marvel to most who see it,—one of
the kind never having been in this part of the
world before. I could not help pitying the poor
creature, whom they keep in constant agitation,
and often give it rum or brandy to drink. I
think they will finish it before long.” The presence
of an elephant in a small room, like one
of the family, seems an uncomfortable arrangement,
even if the “innocent beast” were of
temperate habits; but an elephant in a state
of unseemly “agitation” must have been—at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
such close quarters—a disagreeable and dangerous
companion.</p>

<p>One pastime there is which dates from the
days of Eden, which no creed forbids and no
civilization forswears. Elizabeth Sandwith has
not recorded many little events in her diary
before Henry Drinker looms upon the scene,
though it is only by the inexpressible demureness
of her allusions to her lover that we have
any insight into the state of her affections.
Quaker training does not encourage the easy
unfurling of emotions, and Elizabeth’s heart,
like her soul, was a guarded fortress which no
one was invited to inspect. There is a good
deal of tea-drinking, however, and sometimes
an indiscreet lingering after tea until “unseasonable
hours,” eleven o’clock or thereabouts.
Finally, on the 28th of November, 1760, appears
the following entry: “Went to monthly
meeting this morning, A. Warner and Sister
with me. Declared my intentions of marriage
with my Friend H.&nbsp;D. Sarah Sansom and
Sarah Morris accompanied us to ye Men’s meeting.”
Four weeks later this formidable ordeal
is repeated. She announces in the December<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
monthly meeting that she continues her intentions
of marriage with her friend H.&nbsp;D. In
January the wedding is celebrated; and then,
and then only, H.&nbsp;D. expands into “my dear
Henry,” and assumes a regular, though never
a very prominent, place in the diary.</p>

<p>After this, the entries grow longer, less personal,
and full of allusions to public matters.
We learn how sharply justice was administered
in the Quaker city; for Benjamin Ardey, being
convicted of stealing goods out of a shop
where he was employed, is whipped for two
successive Saturdays,—“once at ye cart’s
tail, and once at ye post.” We learn all about
the delights of travelling in those primitive
days; for the young wife accompanies her husband
on several journeys he is compelled to
make to the little townships of the province,
and gives us a lively account of the roads and
inns,—of the Manatawny Tavern, for example,
and the indignation of the old Dutch landlady
on being asked for clean sheets. Such a notion
as changing sheets for every fresh traveller has
never dawned upon her mind before, and, with
the conservative instincts of her class, she takes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
very unkindly to the suggestion. She is willing
to dampen and press the bed linen, since
these fastidious guests dislike to see it rumpled;
but that is the full extent of her complaisance.
If people want clean sheets, they had better
bring them along.</p>

<p>Most interesting of all, we find in this faithful,
accurate, unemotional diary a very clear
and graphic picture of Philadelphia on the eve
of the Revolution and after the Declaration of
Independence, when deepening discontent and
the sharp strife of opposing factions had forever
destroyed the old placid, prosperous colonial
life. Every one knows how stubborn was
the opposition offered by the Quakers to the
war; how they were hurled from their high
estate by the impetuosity of a patriotism which
would brook no delay; and how, with the passing
away of the Assembly, they lost all vestige
of political power. Scant mercy was shown
them after their downfall by the triumphant
Whigs, and scant justice has been done them
since by historians who find it easier to be eloquent
than impartial. There appears to have
been something peculiarly maddening in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
passive resistance of the Friends, and in their
absolute inability to share the emotions of the
hour. The same quiet antagonism which they
had manifested to the Stamp Act, to the three-penny
duty on tea, and to all unconstitutional
measures on the part of England, they offered
in turn to the mandates of Congress, and to
the exactions of the Executive Council. They
would not renounce their allegiance to the
crown; they would not fight for king or country;
they would not pay the new state tax
levied for the support of the troops; they
would not lift their hands when the tax collector
carried off their goods and chattels in default
of payment; they would not hide their
valuables from the collector’s eyes; they would
not run away when General Howe’s army entered
Philadelphia in the autumn of 1777, nor
when the American troops took possession the
following June. They would not do anything
at all,—not even talk; and perhaps silence
was their most absolutely irritating characteristic,
at a time when other men found pulpit
and platform insufficient for the loud-voiced
eloquence of strife.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span></p>

<p>In reading Elizabeth Drinker’s journal, we
cannot but be struck with the absence of invective,
and, for the most part, of comment.
Anxiety and irritation are alike powerless to
overcome the lifelong habit of restraint. Her
husband appears to have been a stubborn and
consistent Tory, though the restrictions of his
creed compelled him to play an idle part, and
to suffer for a lost cause without striking a
blow in its behalf. He was one of forty gentlemen,
nearly all Friends, who were banished
from Philadelphia in the summer of 1777;
and his wife, with two young children, was left
unprotected, to face the discomforts and dangers
of the times. She was more than equal to
the task. There is as little evidence of timidity
as of rancour in the quiet pages of her diary.
She describes the excitement and confusion
which the news of General Howe’s approach
awakened in Philadelphia, and on the 26th of
September writes: “Well! here are ye English
in earnest. About two or three thousand came
in through Second Street, without opposition or
interruption,—no plundering on ye one side
or ye other. What a satisfaction would it be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
to our dear absent friends,”—of whom one
was her absent husband,—“could they but
be informed of it.”</p>

<p>From this time, all public events are recorded
with admirable brevity and accuracy (Cæsar
would have respected Elizabeth Drinker):
the battle of Germantown, the difficulty of
finding shelter for the wounded soldiers, the
bombardment and destruction of the three
forts which guarded Franklin’s <i lang="fr">chevaux de
frise</i> and separated General Howe from the
fleet, the alarming scarcity of provisions before
the three forts fell. Despite her Tory sympathies
and her husband’s banishment, Elizabeth
sends coffee and wine whey daily to the
wounded American prisoners; rightly thinking
that the English ran a better chance of being
looked after in the hospitals than did her own
countrymen. She suffers no molestation save
once, when, as she writes, “a soldier came to
demand Blankets, which I did not in any wise
agree to. Notwithstanding my refusal, he went
upstairs and took one, and with good nature
begged I would excuse his borrowing it, as it
was by General Howe’s orders.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span></p>

<p>Annoyances and alarms were common
enough in a town overrun by redcoats, who
were not infrequently drunk. Elizabeth, descending
one night to her kitchen, found a
tipsy sergeant making ardent and irresistible
love to her neat maidservant, Ann. On being
told to go away, the man grew bellicose, flourished
his sword, and used the forcible language
of the camp. He had reckoned without his
host, however, when he thought to have matters
all to his own liking under that quiet
Quaker roof. A middle-aged neighbour,—a
Friend,—hearing the tumult, came swiftly to
the rescue, collared the rascal, and wrenched
the sword out of his hand; whereupon Elizabeth,
with delightful sense and caution, carried
the carnal weapon into the parlour, and deliberately
locked it up in a drawer. This sobered
the warrior, and brought him to his senses. To
go back to his barracks without his sword
would be to court unpleasant consequences.
So after trying what some emphasized profanity
would do to help him, and finding it did
nothing at all, he grew humble, said he had
only yielded up his arms “out of pure good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
nature,” and announced his willingness to drink
a glass of wine with such peaceable and friendly
folk. No liquor was produced in response to
this cordial condescension, but he was conducted
carefully to the step, the sword returned
to him, and the door shut in his face; upon
which poor foolish Ann, being refused permission
to follow, climbed the back fence in pursuit
of her lover, and returned to her duties
no more.</p>

<p>Of the brilliant gayety which marked this
memorable winter, of the dinners and balls, of
the plays at the old Southwark Theatre, of the
reckless extravagance and dissipation which
filled the lives of the fair Tory dames who
danced the merry nights away, there is not the
faintest reflection in the pages of this diary.
Even the Mischianza—that marvellous combination
of ball, banquet, and tournament—is
dismissed in a few brief sentences. “Ye scenes
of Vanity and Folly,” says the home-staying
Quaker wife, though still without any rancorous
disapprobation of the worldly pleasures in
which she has no share. To withstand steadfastly
the allurements of life, yet pass no censure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
upon those who yield to them, denotes a
gentle breadth of character, far removed from
the complacent self-esteem of the “unco guid.”
When a young English officer, whom Elizabeth
Drinker is compelled to receive under her roof,
gives an evening concert in his rooms, and the
quiet house rings for the first time with music
and loud voices, her only comment on the
entertainment is that it was “carried on with
as much soberness and good order as the nature
of the thing admitted.” And when he invites
a dozen friends to dine with him, she
merely records that “they made very little
noise, and went away timeously.” It is a good
tonic to read any pages so free from complaints
and repining.</p>

<p>The diary bears witness to the sad distress of
careless merrymakers when the British army
prepared to take the field, to the departure of
many prominent Tories with Admiral Howe’s
fleet, and to the wonderful speed and silence
with which Sir Henry Clinton withdrew his
forces from Philadelphia. “Last night,” writes
Elizabeth on the 18th of June, 1778, “there
were nine thousand of ye British Troops left<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
in Town, and eleven thousand in ye Jerseys.
This morning, when we arose, there was not
one Red-Coat to be seen in Town, and ye Encampment
in ye Jerseys had vanished.”</p>

<p>With the return of Congress a new era of
discomfort began for the persecuted Friends,
whose houses were always liable to be searched,
whose doors were battered down, and whose
windows were broken by the vivacious mob;
while the repeated seizures of household effects
for unpaid war taxes soon left rigid members
of the society—bound at any cost to obey the
dictates of their uncompromising consciences—without
a vestige of furniture in their pillaged
homes. “George Schlosser and a young
man with him came to inquire what stores we
have,” is a characteristic entry in the journal.
“Looked into ye middle room and cellar. Behaved
complaisant. Their authority, the Populace.”
And again: “We have taxes at a
great rate almost daily coming upon us. Yesterday
was seized a walnut Dining Table, five
walnut Chairs, and a pair of large End-Irons,
as our part of a tax for sending two men out
in the Militia.” This experience is repeated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
over and over again, varied occasionally by
some livelier demonstrations on the part of the
“populace,” which had matters all its own way
during those wild years of misrule. When
word came to Philadelphia that Lord Cornwallis
had surrendered, the mob promptly expressed
its satisfaction by wrecking the houses
of Friends and Tory sympathizers. “We had
seventy panes of glass broken,” writes Elizabeth
calmly, “ye sash lights and two panels
of the front Parlour broke in pieces; ye Door
cracked and violently burst open, when they
threw stones into ye House for some time, but
did not enter. Some fared better, some worse.
Some Houses, after breaking ye door, they
entered, and destroyed the Furniture. Many
women and children were frightened into fits,
and ’tis a mercy no lives were lost.”</p>

<p>When peace was restored and the federal
government firmly established, these disorders
came to an end; a new security reigned in
place of the old placid content; and a new
prosperity, more buoyant but less solid than
that of colonial days, gave to Philadelphia, as
to other towns, an air of gayety, and habits of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
increased extravagance. We hear no more of
the men who went with clubs from shop to shop,
“obliging ye people to lower their prices,”—a
proceeding so manifestly absurd that
“Tommy Redman, the Doctor’s apprentice,
was put in prison for laughing as ye Regulators
passed by.” We hear no more of houses
searched or furniture carted away. Elizabeth
Drinker’s diary begins to deal with other matters,
and we learn to our delight that this sedate
Quakeress was passionately fond of reading
romances;—those alluring, long-winded,
sentimental, impossible romances, dear to our
great-grandmothers’ hearts. It is true she does
not wholly approve of such self-indulgence,
and has ever ready some word of excuse for
her own weakness; but none the less “The
Mysteries of Udolpho” and its sister stories
thrill her with delicious emotions of pity and
alarm. “I have read a foolish romance called
‘The Haunted Priory; or the Fortunes of the
House of Rayo,’” she writes on one occasion;
“but I have also finished knitting a pair of
large cotton stockings, bound a petticoat, and
made a batch of gingerbread. This I mention<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
to show that I have not spent the whole day
reading.” Again she confesses to completing
two thick volumes entitled “The Victim of
Magical Illusions; or the Mystery of the Revolution
of P—— L——,” which claimed to be a
“magico-political tale, founded on historic
fact.” “It may seem strange,” she muses,
“that I should begin the year, reading romances.
’Tis a practice I by no means highly
approve, yet I trust I have not sinned, as I
read a little of most things.”</p>

<p>She does indeed, for we find her after a
time dipping into—of all books in the world—Rabelais,
and retiring hastily from the experiment.
“I expected something very sensible
and clever,” she says sadly, “but on looking
over the volumes I was ashamed I had
sent for them.” Mary Wollstonecraft’s “Vindication
of the Rights of Women” pleases her
infinitely better; though she is unwilling to
go so far as the impetuous Englishwoman, in
whom reasonableness was never a predominant
trait. Unrestricted freedom, that curbless wandering
through doubtful paths which end in
social pitfalls, offered no allurement to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
Quaker wife in whom self-restraint had become
second nature; but her own intelligence and
her practical capacity for affairs made her
respect both the attainments and the prerogatives
of her sex. In fact, she appears to have
had exceedingly clear and definite opinions
upon most matters which came within her ken,
and she expresses them in her diary without
diffidence or hesitation. The idol of the Revolutionary
period was Tom Paine; and when we
had established our own republic, the enthusiasm
we felt for republican France predisposed
us still to believe that Paine’s turbulent eloquence
embodied all wisdom, all justice, and
all truth. In Philadelphia the French craze
assumed more dangerous and absurd proportions
than in any other city of the Union.
Her once decorous Quaker streets were ornamented
with liberty-poles and flower-strewn
altars to freedom, around which men and
women, girls and boys, danced the carmagnole,
and shrieked wild nonsense about tyrants and
the guillotine. The once quiet nights were
made hideous with echoes of “<i lang="fr">Ça ira</i>” and the
Marseillaise. Citizens, once sober and sensible,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
wore the <i lang="fr">bonnet rouge</i>, exchanged fraternal
embraces, recited mad odes at dinners, and
played tricks fantastic enough to plunge the
whole hierarchy of heaven into tears,—or
laughter. “If angels have any fun in them,”
says Horace Walpole, “how we must divert
them!” Naturally, amid this popular excitation,
“The Rights of Man” and “The Age of
Reason” were the best-read books of the day,
and people talked about them with that fierce
fervour which forbade doubt or denial.</p>

<p>Now Elizabeth Drinker was never fervent.
Hers was that critical attitude which unconsciously,
but inevitably, weighs, measures, and
preserves a finely adjusted mental balance.
She read “The Age of Reason,” and she read
“The Rights of Man,” and then she read Addison’s
“Evidences of the Christian Religion,”
by way of putting her mind in order, and <em>then</em>
she sat down and <span class="locked">wrote:—</span></p>

<p>“Those who are capable of much wickedness
are, if their minds take a right turn,
capable of much good; and we must allow
that Tom Paine has the knack of writing, or
putting his thoughts and words into method.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
Were he rightly inclined, he could, I doubt
not, say ten times as much in favour of the
Christian religion as he has advanced against
it. And if Lewis ye 17<sup>th</sup> were set up as King
of France, and a sufficient party in his favour,
and Paine highly bribed or flattered, he would
write more for a monarchical government than
he has ever written on the other side.”</p>

<p>Yet orthodoxy alone, unsupported by intellect,
had scant charm for this devout Quakeress.
She wanted, as she expresses it, thoughts
and words put into method. Of a most orthodox
and pious little book, which enjoyed the
approbation of her contemporaries, she writes
as follows: “Read a pamphlet entitled ‘Rewards
and Punishments; or Satan’s Kingdom
Aristocratical,’ written by John Cox, a Philadelphian,
in verse. Not much to the credit of
J.&nbsp;C. as a poet, nor to the credit of Philadelphia;
tho’ the young man may mean well, and
might perhaps have done better in prose.”</p>

<p>“Pilgrim’s Progress,” however, she confesses
she has read three times, and finds that, “tho’
little thought of by some,” she likes it better
and better with each fresh reading. Lavater<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
she admires as a deep and original thinker,
while mistrusting that he has “too good a conceit”
of his own theories and abilities; and the
“Morals” of Confucius she pronounces “a
sweet little piece,” and finer than most things
produced by a more enlightened age.</p>

<p>This is not a bad showing for those easy old
days, when the higher education of women
had not yet dawned as a remote possibility
upon any mind; and when, in truth, the education
of men had fallen to a lower level than
in earlier colonial times. Philadelphia was
sinking into a stagnant mediocrity, her college
had been robbed of its charter, and the
scholarly ambitions (they were never more than
ambitions) of Franklin’s time were fading fast
away. Even Franklin, while writing admirable
prose, had failed to discover any difference
between good and bad verse. His own verse is
as cheerfully and comprehensively bad as any
to be found, and he always maintained that
men should practise the art of poetry, only
that they might improve their prose. This
purely utilitarian view of the poet’s office was
not conducive to high thinking or fine criticism;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
and Elizabeth Drinker was doubtless in a very
small minority when she objected to “Satan’s
Kingdom Aristocratical,” on the score of its
halting measures.</p>

<p>The most striking characteristic of our
Quaker diarist is precisely this clear, cold, unbiased
judgment, this sanity of a well-ordered
mind. What she lacks, what the journal lacks
from beginning to end, is some touch of human
and ill-repressed emotion, some word of
pleasant folly, some weakness left undisguised
and unrepented. The attitude maintained
throughout is too judicial, the repose of heart
and soul too absolute to be endearing. Here is
a significant entry, illustrating as well as any
other this nicely balanced nature, which gave
to all just what was due, and nothing <span class="locked">more:—</span></p>

<p>“There has been a disorder lately among ye
cats. Our poor old Puss, who has been for
some time past unwell, died this morning, in ye
13th year of her age. Peter dug a grave two
feet deep on ye bank in our garden, under ye
stable window, where E.&nbsp;S., Peter and I saw
her decently interred. <em>I had as good a regard
for her as was necessary.</em>”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span></p>

<p>Was ever affection meted out like this?
Was there ever such Quaker-like precision of
esteem? For thirteen years that cat had been
Elizabeth Drinker’s companion, and she had
acquired for her just as good a regard as was
necessary, and no more. It was not thus Sir
Walter spoke, when Hinse of Hinsdale lay dead
beneath the windows of Abbotsford, slain by
the great staghound, Nimrod. It was not thus
that M. Gautier lamented the consumptive
Pierrot. It is not thus that the heart mourns,
when a little figure, friendly and familiar, sits
no longer by our desolate hearth.</p>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">The</span> literature of a nation is rooted in national
characteristics. Foreign influences may
dominate it for a time; but that which is born
of the soil is imperishable, and must, by virtue
of tenacity, conquer in the end. England,
after the Restoration, tried very hard to be
French, and the “happy and unreflecting wantonness”
of her earlier song was chilled into
sobriety by the measured cadences of Gallic
verse; yet the painful and perverse effort to
adjust herself to strange conditions left her
more triumphantly English than before. We
are tethered to our kind, and the wisest of all
wise limitations is that which holds us well<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
within the sphere of natural and harmonious
development.</p>

<p>It is true, however, that nationality betrays
itself less in lyrics, and, above all, less in love
lyrics, than in any other form of literature.
Love is a malady, the common symptoms of
which are the same in all patients; and though
love-songs—like battle-songs and drinking-songs—are
seldom legitimate offsprings of experience,
they are efforts to express in words
that sweet and transient pain. “<i lang="fr">Les âmes
bien nées</i>”—without regard to birthplace—clearly
of their passion, and seek their
“<i lang="fr">petit coin de bonheur</i>” under Southern and
Northern skies. The Latin races have, indeed,
depths of reserve underlying their apparent
frankness, and the Saxons have a genius for
self-revelation underlying their apparent reticence;
but these traits count for little in the
refined duplicity of the love-song.</p>

<p class="center" lang="fr">
Garde bien ta belle folie!
</p>

<p class="in0">has been its burden ever since it was first
chanted by minstrel lips.</p>

<p>M. Brunetière frankly admits the inferiority<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
of the French lyric, an inferiority which he attributes
to the predominance of social characteristics
in the literature, as in the life of
France. When poetry is compelled to fulfil a
social function, to express social conditions and
social truths, to emphasize fundamental principles
and balance contrasted forces, the founts of
lyrical inspiration are early dried. Individualism
is their source,—the sharp, clear striking
of the personal note; and the English, says
M. Brunetière, excel in this regard. “To Lucasta.
Going to the Warres,” has no perfect
counterpart in the love-songs of other lands.</p>

<p>Even the eager desire of the Frenchman to
be always intelligible (“That which is not
lucid is not French”) militates against the perfection
of the lyric. So too does his exquisite
and inborn sense of proportion. “Measure,”

<p>“What,” asks Mr. Brownell hopelessly,
“has become of this Celtic strain in the French
nature?”—a strain which found vent in the
“<i lang="fr">poésie courtoise</i>,” playful, amorous, laden
with delicate subtleties and fond conceits. This
poesie—once the delight of Christendom—echoes
still in Petrarch’s sonnets and in Shakespeare’s
madrigals; but it is difficult to link its
sweet extravagances with the chiselled verse of
later days, and critics forget the past in their
careful contemplation of the present. “French
poetry,” says Mr. Zangwill, “has always leant
to the frigid, the academic, the rhetorical,—in
a word, to the prosaic. The spirit of Boileau
has ruled it from his cold marble urn.”</p>

<p>But long before Boileau lay in his urn—or
in his cradle—the poets of France, like the
poets of Albion, sang with facile grace of love,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
and dalliance, and the glory of youth and spring.
The fact that Boileau ignored and despised
their song, and taught his obedient followers to
ignore and despise it also, cannot silence those
early notes. When he descended frigidly to
his grave, Euterpe tucked up her loosened hair,
and sandalled her bare white feet, and girdled
her disordered robes into decent folds. Perhaps
it was high time for these reforms. Nothing
is less seductive in middle age than the
careless gayety of youth. But once France
was young, and Euterpe a slip of a girl, and
no grim shadow of that classic urn rested on
the golden days when Aucassin—model of defiant
and conquering lovers—followed Nicolette
into the deep, mysterious woods.</p>

<p>With just such sweet absurdities, such pardonable
insincerities, the poets of Elizabeth’s
England fill their amorous verse. George Gascoigne
“swims in heaven” if his mistress smiles
upon him; John Lyly unhesitatingly asserts
that Daphne’s voice “tunes all the spheres;”
and Lodge exhausts the resources of the vegetable
and mineral kingdoms in searching for
comparisons by which to set forth the beauties<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
of Rosalind. The philosophy of love is alike on
both sides of the Channel, and expressed in
much the same terms of soft insistence. <i lang="la">Carpe
diem</i> is, and has always been, the lover’s maxim;
and the irresistible eloquence of the lyric resolves
itself finally into these two words of warning,
whether urged by Celt or Saxon. Herrick
is well aware of their supreme significance when
he <span class="locked">sings:—</span></p>

</div>

<p>Ronsard, pleading with his mistress, strikes
the same relentless <span class="locked">note:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p>May-day comes alike in England and in
France. Herrick and Jean Passerat, poets of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
Devonshire and of Champagne, are equally determined
that two fair sluggards, who love their
pillows better than the dewy grass, shall rise
from bed, and share with them the sparkling
rapture of the early dawn. Herrick’s verse,
laden with the freshness of the Spring, rings
imperatively in Corinna’s sleepy <span class="locked">ears:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Get up, get up, for shame! The blooming Morn</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Upon her wings presents the god unshorn.</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Fresh-quilted colours through the air.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Get up, sweet Slug-a-bed, and see</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The dew bespangling herb and tree.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And then—across the gayety of the song—the
deepening note of persuasion strikes a
familiar <span class="locked">chord:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Come, let us go, while we are in our prime;</div>

</div>

<p>Passerat is no less insistent. The suitors of
the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries seem
to have dedicated the chill hours of early
morning to their courtship. Nor was the custom
purely pastoral and poetic. When Lovelace
makes his appointments with Clarissa Harlowe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
at five <span class="smcap">A.&nbsp;M.</span>, the modern reader—if
Richardson has a modern reader—is wont to
think the hour an unpropitious one; but to
Herrick and to the Pléiade it would have
seemed rational enough.</p>

<p>No less striking is the similarity between
the reproachful couplets in which the singers
of England and of France delight in denouncing
their unfaithful fair ones, or in confessing
with harmonious sighs the transient nature of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
their own emotions. Inconstancy is the breath
of love’s nostrils, and the inspiration of love’s
songs, which enchant us because they express
an exquisite sentiment in its brief moment of
ascendency. The tell-tale past, the dubious future,
are alike discreetly ignored. Love in the
drama and in the romance plays rather a heavy
part. It is too obtrusively omniscient. It is
far too self-assertive. Yet the average taxpayer,
as has been well remarked, is no more
capable of a grand passion than of a grand
opera. The utmost he can achieve is some fair,
fleeting hour, and with the imperative gladness
of such an hour the love-song thrills sympathetically.

<p>Mr. Lang is of the opinion that no Gallic
verse has equalled in audacity this confession
of limitations, this “Apologia pro Vita Sua;”
and perhaps its light-heartedness is well out of
general reach. But the French lover, like the
English, was made of threats and promises
alike fruitless of fulfilment, and Phillis had
many a fair foreign sister, no whit more
worthy of regard. Only, amid the laughter
and raillery of a Latin people, there rings ever
an undertone of regret,—not passionate and
heart-breaking, as in Drayton’s bitter <span class="locked">cry,—</span></p>

<p class="center">
Since there’s no help, come let us kiss and part,

<p>The note deepens as we pass into the more
conscious art of later years, but it is always
French in its grace and moderation. How endurable
is the regret with which de Musset

<p>In Murger’s familiar verses, so pretty and
gay and heartsick, in the finer art of Gautier,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
in the cloudy lyrics of Verlaine, we catch
again and again this murmur of poignant but
subdued regret, this sigh for the light love that
has so swiftly fled. The delicacy of the sentiment
is unmatched in English song. The
Saxon can be profoundly sad, and he can—or
at least he could—be ringingly and recklessly
gay; but the mood which is neither sad nor
gay, which is fed by refined emotions, and
tranquillized by time’s subduing touch, has
been expressed oftener and better in France.
Four hundred and fifty years ago François Villon
touched this exquisite chord in his “<span lang="fr">Ballade
des Dames du Temps Jadis</span>,” and it has
vibrated gently ever since. We hear it echoing
with melancholy grace in these simple lines
of Gérard de <span class="locked">Nerval:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza" lang="fr">
    <div class="verse indent0">Où sont les amoureuses?</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Elles sont au tombeau!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Elles sont plus heureuses,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Dans un séjour plus beau.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Nerval, like Villon, had drunk deep of the
bitterness of life, but he never permitted its
dregs to pollute the clearness of his <span class="locked">song:—</span></p>

<p class="center" lang="fr">
Et vent que l’on soit <em>triste</em> avec sobriété.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span></p>

<p>In the opinion of many critics, the lyric was
not silenced, only chilled, by the development
of the classical spirit in France, and the corresponding
conversion of England. Its flute notes
were heard now and then amid the decorous
couplets that delighted well-bred ears. Waller
undertook the reformation of English verse, and
accomplished it to his own and his readers’ radiant
satisfaction; yet Waller’s seven-year suit
of Lady Dorothy Sidney is the perfection of
that poetic love-making which does not lead,
and is not expected to lead, to anything definite
and tangible. Never were more charming tributes
laid at the feet of indifferent beauty;
never was indifference received with less concern.
Sacharissa listened and smiled. The
world—the august little world of rank and
distinction—listened and smiled with her,
knowing the poems were written as much for
its edification as for hers; and Waller, well
pleased with the audience, nursed his passion
tenderly until it flowered into another delicate
blossom of verse. The situation was full of enjoyment
while it lasted; and when the seven
years were over, Lady Dorothy married Henry,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
Lord Spencer, who never wrote any poetry
at all; while her lover said his last good-bye in
the most sparkling and heart-whole letter ever
penned by inconstant man. What would the
author of “The Girdle,” and “Go, Lovely Rose,”
have thought of Browning’s uneasy rapture?</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">O lyric love, half angel and half bird,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And all a wonder and a wild desire.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He would probably have pointed out the exaggeration
of the sentiment, and the corresponding
looseness of the lines. He would certainly
have agreed with the verdict of M. Sévelinges,
had that acute critic uttered it in his day. “It
is well,” says M. Sévelinges, “that passionate
love is rare. Its principal effect is to detach
men from all their surroundings, to isolate them,
to render them independent of the relations
which they have not formed for themselves;
and a civilized society composed of lovers would
return infallibly to misery and barbarism.”</p>

<p>Here is the French point of view, expressed
with that lucidity which the nation so highly
esteems. Who shall gainsay its correctness?
But the Saxon, like the Teuton, is sentimental
to his heart’s core, and finds some illusions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
better worth cherishing than truth. It was an
Englishman, and one to whom the epithet
“cynical” has been applied oftenest, and with

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_SPINSTER"><span id="toclink_170"></span>THE SPINSTER</h2>
</div>

<div class="blockquot inhead">

<p>The most ordinarie cause of a single life is liberty, especially
in certain self-pleasing and humorous minds, which
are so sensible of every restriction, as they wil goe neere to
thinke their girdles and garters to be bonds and shakles.—<span class="smcap">Bacon.</span></p>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">In</span> the Zend-Avesta, as translated by Anquetil-Duperron,
there is a discouraging sentence
passed upon voluntary spinsterhood: “The
damsel who, having reached the age of eighteen,
shall refuse to marry, must remain in Hell until
the earth is shattered.”</p>

<p>This assurance is interesting, less because of
its provision for the spinster’s future than because
it takes into consideration the possibility
of her refusing to marry;—a possibility which
slipped out of men’s minds from the time of
Zoroaster until our present day. A vast deal
has been written about marriage in the interval;
but it all bears the imprint of the masculine
intellect, reasoning from the masculine point of
view, for the benefit of masculinity, and ignoring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
in the most natural manner the woman’s
side of life. The trend of argument is mainly
in one direction. While a few cynics gibe at
love and conjugal felicity, the mass of poets
and philosophers unite in extolling wedlock.
Some praise its pleasures, others its duties, and
others again merely point out with Euripides
that, as children cannot be bought with gold
or silver, there is no way of acquiring these
coveted possessions save by the help of women.
Now and then a rare word of sympathy is flung
to the wife, as in those touching lines of Sophocles
upon the young girls sold in their “gleeful
maidenhood” to sad or shameful marriage-beds.
But the important thing to be achieved is
the welfare and happiness of men. The welfare
and happiness of women are supposed—not
without reason—to follow as a necessary
sequence; but this is a point which excites
no very deep concern.</p>

<p>Catholic Christendom throughout the Middle
Ages, and long afterwards, offered one practical
solution to the problem of unmated and unprotected
womanhood,—the convent. The girl
robbed of all hope of marriage by bitter stress<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
of war or poverty, the girl who feared too deeply
the turmoil and violence of the world, found
shelter in the convent. Within its walls she
was reasonably safe, and her vows lent dignity
to her maidenhood. Bride of the Church, she
did not rank as a spinster, and her position had
the advantage of being accurately defined; she
was part of a recognized social and ecclesiastical
system. No one feels this more solidly
than does a nun to-day, and no one looks with
more contempt upon unmarried women in the
world. In her eyes there are but two vocations,—wifehood
and consecrated virginity.
She perceives that the wife and the religious
are transmitters of the world’s traditions; while
the spinster is an anomaly, with no inherited
background to give repute and distinction to
her rôle.</p>

<p>This point of view is the basis of much criticism,
and has afforded scope for the ridicule
of the satirist, and for the outpourings of the
sentimentalist. A great many brutal jests
have been flung at the old maid, and floods of
sickly sentiment have been wasted on her behalf.
She has been laughed at frankly as one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
rejected by men, and she has been wept over as
a wasted force, withering patiently under the
blight of this rejection. “Envy, hatred, malice,
and all uncharitableness” have been ascribed
to her on one side, and a host of low-spirited
and treacly virtues, on the other. The spinster
of comedy is a familiar figure. A perfectly
simple and ingenuous example is the maiden aunt
in “Pickwick,” Miss Rachel Wardle, whom
Mr. Tupman loves, and with whom Mr. Jingle
elopes. She is spiteful and foolish, envious of
youth and easy to dupe. She is utterly ridiculous,
and a fair mark for laughter. She is
pinched, and withered, and hopelessly removed
from all charm of womanhood; and—it may
be mentioned parenthetically—she is fifty
years old. We have her brother’s word for it.</p>

<p>There is nothing in this straightforward
caricature that could, or that should, wound
anybody’s sensibilities. The fun is of a robust
order; the ridicule has no subtlety and no sting.
But the old maid of the sentimentalists, a creature
stricken at heart, though maddeningly
serene and impossibly unselfish, is every bit as
remote from reality, and far less cheerful to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
contemplate. What can be more offensive than
the tearful plea for consideration put forward
by her apologists, who, after all, tolerate her
only because, having no career of her own, she
is expected to efface herself in the interests of
other people. “The peculiar womanly virtues,”
says a recent writer upon this fruitful theme,
“the power of self-sacrifice, warm sympathies,
compassion, patient endurance, represent an
untold amount of suffering on the part of the
weaker sex in past ages. It is to the world’s
advantage that the fruit of such suffering be
not lost.”</p>

<p>Here is a sparkling view of life; here is
a joyous standpoint of observation. There is
generosity enough in the world to win for the
dejected, the wistful, the pathetic woman a
fair share of commiseration; provided always
that she does not oppose her own interests to
the interests of those around her. But what
if she honestly prefers her own interests,—a
not uncommon attitude of mind? What if
patient endurance be the very last virtue to
which she can lay claim? What if she is not
in the least wistful, and never casts longing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
looks at her sister-in-law’s babies, nor strains
them passionately to her heart, nor deems it a
privilege to nurse her nephews through whooping-cough
and measles, nor offers herself in
any fashion as a holocaust upon other people’s
domestic altars? What if, holding her life in
her two hands, and knowing it to be her only
real possession, she disposes of it in the way
she feels will give her most content, swimming
smoothly in the stream of her own nature, and
clearly aware that happiness lies in the development
of her individual tastes and acquirements?
Such a woman may, as Mr. Brownell
says, exhibit transparently “her native and elemental
inconsistencies;” but she calls for no
commiseration, and perhaps adds a trifle to the
harmonious gayety of earth.</p>

<p>That she should be censured for laying claim
to what is truly hers seems unkind and irrational,—a
tyranny of opinion. Marriage is a
delightful thing; but it is not, and never can
be, a duty; nor is it as a duty that men and
women have hitherto zealously practised it.
The outcry against celibacy as a “great social
disease” is louder than the situation warrants.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
It is the echo of an older protest against the
deferring of the inevitable wedding-day; against
the perverse “boggling at every object,” which
Burton found so exasperating a trait in youth,
and which La Bruyère calmly and conclusively
condemns. “There is,” says the French moralist,
“a time when even the richest women
ought to marry. They cannot allow their
youthful chances to escape them, without the
risk of a long repentance. The importance
of their reputed wealth seems to diminish with
their beauty. A young woman, on the contrary,
has everything in her favour; and if, added to
youth, she possesses other advantages, she is
so much the more desirable.”</p>

<p>This is the simplest possible exposition of
the masculine point of view. It is plain that
nothing is farther from La Bruyère’s mind
than the possibility of a lifelong spinsterhood
for even the most procrastinating heiress. He
merely points out that it would be more reasonable
in her to permit a husband to enjoy
her youth and her wealth simultaneously. The
modern moralist argues with less suavity that
the rich woman who remains unmarried because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
she relishes the wide and joyous activity fostered
by her independence is a transgressor against
social laws. She sins through dire selfishness,
and her punishment is the loss of all that gives
dignity and importance to her life. Only a
few months ago a strenuous advocate of matrimony—as
if matrimony had need of advocates—pointed
out judicially in “Harper’s
Magazine” that the childless woman has nothing
to show for all the strength and skill she
has put into the business of living. She may
be intelligent, stimulating, and serene. She may
have seen much of the world, and have taken its
lessons to heart. She may have filled her days
with useful and agreeable occupations. Nevertheless,
he considers her existence “in the long
run, a bootless sort of errand;” doubting
whether she has acquired anything that can
make life more interesting to her at thirty-five,
at forty-five, at seventy. “And so much the
worse for her.”</p>

<p>This is assuming that there <em>are</em> no interests
outside of marriage; no emotions, ambitions,
nor obligations unconnected with the rearing
of children. We are invited to believe that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
great world, filled to its brim with pleasures
and pains, duties, diversions, and responsibilities,
cannot keep a woman going—even to
thirty-five—without the incentive of maternity.
Accustomed as we are to the expansive utterances
of conjugal felicity, this seems a trifle
overbearing. Charles Lamb thought it hard to
be asked by a newly wedded lady how—being
a bachelor—he could assume to know anything
about the breeding of oysters. To-day the
expressed doubt is how—being spinsters or
bachelors—we can assume to know anything
about the serious significance of life.</p>

<p>It is not the rich and presumably self-indulgent
woman alone who is admonished to mend
her ways and marry. The sentence extends to
the working classes, who are held to be much
in fault. Even the factory girl, toiling for her
daily bread, has been made the subject of censure
as unjust as it is severe. What if she does
covet the few poor luxuries,—the neat shoes
and pretty frock which represent her share of
æsthetic development? What if she does enjoy
her independence, and the power to spend as
she pleases the money for which she works so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
hard? These things are her inalienable rights.
To limit them is tyranny. To denounce them
is injustice. We may sincerely believe that she
would be better and happier if she married;
and that the bringing up of children on the
precarious earnings of a working-man would be
a more legitimate field for her intelligence and
industry. But it is her privilege to decide this
point for herself; and no one is warranted in
questioning her decision. She does not owe
matrimony to the world.</p>

<p>There is still another class of women whose
spinsterhood is hardly a matter of choice, yet
whose independence has aroused especial criticism
and denunciation. A few years ago there
appeared in “Macmillan’s Magazine” a well-written
article on the educated, unmarried, and
self-supporting women, who, in London alone,
fill countless clerical, official, and academic
positions. It was pointed out that these toilers,
debarred by poverty from agreeable social conditions,
lead lives of cheerful and honourable
frugality, preserving their self-respect, seeking
help and commiseration from none, enjoying
their scanty pleasures with intelligence, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
doing their share of work with eager and anxious
precision. Surely if any creatures on God’s
earth merit some esteem, these spinsters may
be held in deference. Yet the writer of the
article unhesitatingly, though not unkindly,
summed up the case against them. No woman
with a sensitive conscience, he avowed, can be
happy on such terms. “She more than suspects
she is in danger of serious moral deterioration....
She is aware that her mode of life is
essentially selfish, and therefore stands condemned.”</p>

<p>In the name of Heaven, why? Would her
mode of life be less selfish if she asked a
support from a married brother, or a wealthy
aunt? Is it necessary to her moral well-being
that she should pass her days in polite servitude?
Apparently it is; for hardly had the
“Macmillan” article appeared, when a more
strenuous critic in the “Spectator” took its
writer severely to task, not for his censorship,
but for his leniency. The “Spectator” declared
in round terms that the woman who
devotes herself to the difficult problem of her
own support “lives a more or less unnatural<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
life of self-dependence;—the degree of the
unnaturalness depending on the degree of her
self-dependence, and the completeness of the
disappearance of that religious devoutness
which prevents loneliness from degenerating
into self-dependence.”</p>

<p>Shades of Addison and Steele pardon
this cumbrous sentence! That self-dependence
might degenerate into loneliness we can understand;
but how or why should loneliness
degenerate into self-dependence, and what has
either loneliness or self-dependence to do with
the “disappearance of religious devoutness”?
Is religion also a perquisite of family life?
May we not be devout in solitude? “Be able
to be alone,” counsels Sir Thomas Browne,
whose piety was of a most satisfying order.
It is not profane to plan or to advance an individual
career. We do not insult Providence
by endeavouring to provide for ourselves.
And if the restlessness of modern life impels
women of independent fortune to enter congenial
fields of work, the freedom to do this
thing is their birthright and prerogative. We
can no more sweep back the rising tide of interests<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
and ambitions than we can sweep back
the waves of the Atlantic. A hundred years
ago, marriage was for an intelligent woman
a necessary entrance into life, a legitimate
method of carrying out her ideas and her aims.
To-day she tries to carry them out, whether
she be married or not. Perhaps some awkwardness
of self-assertion disfigures that “polished
moderation” which is her highest grace; but
the frank resoluteness of her attitude is more
agreeable to contemplate than sad passivity
and endurance. Mr. John Stuart Mill said
that a woman’s inheritance of “subjection”—he
never minced words—induced, on the one
hand, a capacity for self-sacrifice, and, on the
other, a habit of pusillanimity. Both characteristics
have been modified by changing circumstances.
But with more courage and less self-immolation
has come a happier outlook upon
life, and an energy which is not always misplaced.
Mariana no longer waits tearfully in
the Moated Grange. She leaves it as quickly
as possible for some more healthful habitation,
and a more engaging pursuit.</p>

<p>There is one English author who has defended<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
with delicacy that sagacious self-respect
which, even in his time, preserved a woman
now and then from the blunder of an unequal
and unbecoming marriage. De Quincey, extolling
the art of letter-writing, pays this curious
bit of homage to his most valued <span class="locked">correspondents:—</span></p>

<p>“Three out of four letters in the mail-bag
will be written by that class of women who have
the most leisure, and the most interest in a
correspondence by the post; and who combine
more intelligence, cultivation, and thoughtfulness
than any other class in Europe. They are
the unmarried women over twenty-five, who,
from mere dignity of character, have renounced
all prospects of conjugal and parental life,
rather than descend into habits unsuitable to
their birth. Women capable of such sacrifices,
and marked by such strength of mind, may be
expected to think with deep feeling, and to
express themselves (unless when they have been
too much biassed by bookish connections) with
natural grace.”</p>

<p>This is something very different from the
“All for Love, and the World well lost,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
flaunted by novelists and poets; very different
from the well-worn “<span lang="fr">Quand on n’a pas ce qu’on
aime, il faut aimer ce qu’on a</span>,” which has
married generations of women. But in the
philosophy of life, the power to estimate and to
balance scores heavily for success. It is not an
easy thing to be happy. It takes all the brains,
and all the soul, and all the goodness we
possess. We may fail of our happiness, strive
we ever so bravely; but we are less likely to
fail if we measure with judgment our chances
and our capabilities. To glorify spinsterhood is
as ridiculous as to decry it. Intelligent women
marry or remain single, because in married or
in single life they see their way more clearly to
content. They do not, in either case, quarrel
with fate which has modelled them for, and
fitted them into, one groove rather than another;
but follow, consciously or unconsciously, the
noble maxim of Marcus Aurelius: “Love that
only which the gods send thee, and which is
spun with the thread of thy destiny.”</p>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">“Potter</span> hates Potter, and Poet hates Poet,”—so
runs the wisdom of the ancients,—but
tourist hates tourist with a cordial Christian
animosity that casts all Pagan prejudices in
the shade. At home we tolerate—sometimes
we even love—our fellow creatures. We can
see large masses of them in church and theatre,
we can be jostled by them in streets, and be
kept waiting by them in shops, and be inconvenienced
by them at almost every turn, without
rancorous annoyance or ill will. But abroad
it is our habit to regard all other travellers in
the light of personal and unpardonable grievances.
They are intruders into our chosen
realms of pleasure, they jar upon our sensibilities,
they lessen our meagre share of comforts,
they are everywhere in our way, they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
are always an unnecessary feature in the landscape.</p>

<p class="center">
I love not man the less, but nature more,
</p>

<p class="in0">wrote Byron, when sore beset; but the remark
cannot be said to bear the stamp of truth.
Nine tenths of the poet’s love for nature was
irritation at the boundless injustice and the
sterling stupidity of man. He would never have
expressed so much general benevolence had
Europe in his time been the tourist-trodden
platform it is to-day.</p>

<p>We might, were we disposed to be reasonable,
bear in mind the humiliating fact that
we too are aliens, out of harmony with our
surroundings, and marring, as far as in us lies,
the charm of ancient street or the still mountain
side. Few of us, however, are so candid
as Mr. Henry James, who, while detesting his
fellow travellers, frankly admits his own inherent
undesirability. “We complain,” he
says, “of a hackneyed and cockneyized Europe;
but wherever, in desperate search of the
untrodden, we carry our much-labelled luggage,
our bad French, our demand for a sitzbath
and pale ale, we rub off the bloom of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
local colour, and establish a precedent for
unlimited intrusion.”</p>

<p>This is generous, and it is not a common
point of view. “Americans do roam so,” I
heard an Englishwoman remark discontentedly
in Cook’s Paris office, where she was waiting
with manifest impatience while the clerk made
up tickets for a party of trans-Atlantic kindred.
It never seemed to occur to her that she
was not upon her own native heath. The habit
of classifying our distastes proves how strong
is our general sense of injury. We dislike
English tourists more than French, or French
more than English, or Americans more than
either, or Germans most of all,—the last a
common verdict. There is a power of universal
mastery about the travelling Teuton which
affronts our feebler souls. We cannot cope
with him; we stand defeated at every turn by
his resistless determination to secure the best.
The windows of the railway carriages, the little
sunny tables in the hotel dining-rooms, the
back seats—commanding the view—of the
Swiss <i lang="fr">funiculaires</i>;—all these strong positions
he occupies at once with the strategical genius<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
of a great military nation. No weak concern
for other people’s comfort mars the simple
straightforwardness of his plans, nor interferes
with their prompt and masterly execution.
Amid the confusion and misery of French and
Italian railway stations, he plays a conqueror’s
part, commanding the services of the porters,
and marching off triumphantly with his innumerable
pieces of hand luggage, while his
fellow tourists clamour helplessly for aid. “The
Germans are a rude, unmannered race, but
active and expert where their personal advantages
are concerned,” wrote the observant
Froissart many years ago. He could say neither
more nor less were he travelling over the
Continent to-day.</p>

<p>Granted that the scurrying crowds who infest
Italy every spring, and Switzerland every
summer, are seldom “children of light;” that
their motives in coming are, for the most part,
unintelligible, and their behaviour the reverse
of urbane;—even then there seems to be no
real cause for the demoralization that follows
in their wake, for the sudden and bitter change
that comes over a land when once the stranger<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
claims it as his own. It is the cordial effort
made to meet the tourist halfway, to minister
to his supposed wants, and to profit by his supposed
wealth, that desolates the loveliest cities
in the world, that flouts the face of nature, and
rasps our most tender sensibilities. Venice
turned into a grand bazaar, Vaucluse packed
with stalls for the sale of every object which
ought never to be found there, the Falls of the
Rhine lit up by electricity, like the transformation
scene of a ballet;—is it our misfortune
or our fault that these things may be directly
traceable to us? Do we <em>like</em> to see a trolley-car
bumping its way to Chillon, or to find the
castle entrance stocked with silver spoons, and
wooden bears, and miniature Swiss châlets?
Shall I confess that I watched a youthful
countrywoman of my own carrying delightedly
away—as an appropriate souvenir of the
spot—a group consisting of Mother bear sitting
up languidly in bed, Nurse bear wrapping
Infant bear in swaddling-cloths, and Doctor
bear holding a labelled bottle of medicine?
There seemed a certain incongruity about the
purchase, and a certain lack of sensibility in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
the purchaser. Chillon is not without sombre
associations, nor poetic life; and if Byron’s
“Prisoner” no longer wrings our hearts, still
youth is youth,—or, at least, it used to be,—and
the</p>

<p class="center">
seven columns, massy and grey,
</p>

<p class="in0">were at one time part of its inheritance. Is it
better, I wonder, to begin life with a few illusions,
a little glow, a pardonable capacity for
enthusiasm, or to be so healthily free from
every breath of sentiment as to be capable—at
eighteen—of buying comic bears within the
melancholy portals of Chillon.</p>

<p>Travelling, like novel-writing, is but a modern
form of activity; and tourists, like novelists,
are increasing at so fearful a rate of speed
that foreign countries and library shelves bid
fair to be equally overrun. There <em>was</em> a time
when good men looked askance both upon the
page of fable, and upon those far countries
where reality was stranger than romance. “I
was once in Italy myself,” confesses the pious
Roger Ascham; “but I thank God my abode
there was but nine days.” Nine days seem a
scant allowance for Italy. Even the business-like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
traveller who now scampers “<em>more Americano</em>”
over Europe is wont to deal more generously
with this, its fairest land. But in Roger
Ascham’s time nine days would hardly have
permitted a glimpse at the wonders from which
he so swiftly and fearfully withdrew.</p>

<p>Now and then, as years went by, men with
a genuine love of roving and adventure wandered
far afield, unbaffled by difficulties, and
unscandalized by foreign creeds and customs.
James Howell, that most delightful of gossips
and chroniclers, has so much to say in praise
of “the sweetness and advantage of travel,”
that even now his letters—nearly three hundred
years old—stir in our hearts the wayfarer’s
restless longing. After being “toss’d
from shore to shore for thirty-odd months,” he
can still write stoutly: “And tho’ these frequent
removes and tumblings under climes of
differing temper were not without some danger,
yet the delight which accompany’d them was
far greater; and it is impossible for any man
to conceive the true pleasure of peregrination,
but he who actually enjoys and puts it into
practice.” Moreover, he is well assured that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
travel is “a profitable school, a running academy,
and nothing conduceth more to the building
up and perfecting of a man. They that
traverse the world up and down have the clearest
understanding; being faithful eye-witnesses
of those things which others receive but in
trust, whereunto they must yield an intuitive
consent, and a kind of implicit faith.”</p>

<p>In one respect, however, Howell was a true
son of his day, of the day when Prelacy and
Puritanism alternately afflicted England. For
foreign cities and foreign citizens he had a keen
and intelligent appreciation; nothing daunted
his purpose, nor escaped his observation; but
he drew the line consistently at the charms of
nature. The “high and hideous Alps” were as
abhorrent to his soul as they were, a century
later, to Horace Walpole’s. It was the gradual—I
had almost said the regrettable—discovery
of beauty in these “uncouth, huge, monstrous
excrescences” which gave a new and powerful
impetus to travel. Here at least were innocent
objects of pilgrimage, wonders uncontaminated
by the evils which were vaguely supposed to
lurk in the hearts of Paris and of Rome. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
was many, many years after Roger Ascham’s
praiseworthy flight from Italy that we find Patty
More, sister to the ever-virtuous Hannah, writing
apprehensively to a <span class="locked">friend:—</span></p>

<p>“What is to become of us? All the world,
as it seems, flying off to France, that land of
deep corruption and wickedness, made hotter
in sin by this long and dreadful Revolution.
<em>The very curates in our neighbourhood have
been.</em> I fear a deterioration in the English
character is taking place. The Ambassador’s
lady in Paris could not introduce the English
ladies till they had covered up their bodies.”</p>

<p>This sounds rather as though England were
corrupting France. Perhaps, notwithstanding
the truly reprehensible conduct of the curates,—for
whom no excuse can be made,—the
exodus was not so universal as the agitated
Mrs. Patty seemed to think. There were still
plenty of stay-at-homes, lapped in rural virtues,
and safe from contamination;—like the squire
who told Jane Austen’s father that he and his
wife had been quarrelling the night before as
to whether Paris were in France, or France in
Paris. The “Roman Priest Conversion Branch<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
Tract Society” gave to bucolic Britain all the
Continental details it required.</p>

<p>But when the “hideous Alps” became the
“matchless heights,” the “palaces of Nature,”
when poets had sung their praises lustily, and
it had dawned upon the minds of unpoetic men
that they were not merely obstacles to be
crossed, but objects to be looked at and admired;—<em>then</em>
were gathered slowly the advance
guards of that mighty army of sight-seers
which sweeps over Europe to-day. “Switzerland,”
writes Mr. James gloomily, “has become
a show country. I think so more and more
every time I come here. Its use in the world
is to reassure persons of a benevolent imagination
who wish the majority of mankind had
only a little more elevating amusement. Here
is amusement for a thousand years, and as
elevating certainly as mountains five miles high
can make it. I expect to live to see the summit
of Mount Rosa heated by steam-tubes, and
adorned with a hotel setting three dinners a
day.”</p>

<p>The last words carry a world of weight.
They are the key-note of the situation. Tourists<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
in these years of grace need a vast deal of
food and drink to keep their enthusiasm warm.
James Howell lived contentedly upon bread
and grapes for three long months in Spain.
Byron wrote mockingly from Lisbon: “Comfort
must not be expected by folks that go
a-pleasuring;” and no one ever bore manifold
discomforts with more endurance and gayety
than he did. But now that the “grand tour”—once
the experience of a lifetime—has
become a succession of little tours, undertaken
every year or two, things are made easy for
slackened sinews and impaired digestions. The
average traveller concentrates his attention
sternly upon the slowness of the Italian trains,
the shortness of the Swiss beds, the surliness
of the German officials, the dirt of the French
inns, the debatableness of the Spanish butter,
the universal and world-embracing badness of
the tea. These things form the staple topics
of discussion among men and women who exchange
confidences at the table d’hôte, and they
lend a somewhat depressing tone to the conversation,
which is not greatly enlivened by a few
side remarks connecting the drinking water<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
with the germs of typhoid fever. It is possible
that the talkers have enjoyed some exhilarating
experiences, some agreeable sensations, which
they hesitate—mistakenly—to reveal; but
they wax eloquent on the subject of cost. “The
continual attention to pecuniary disbursements
detracts terribly from the pleasure of all
travelling schemes,” wrote Shelley in a moment
of dejection; and the sentiment, couched in less
Johnsonian English, is monotonously familiar
to-day. Paying for things is a great trouble
and a great expense; and the tourist’s uneasy
apprehension that he is being overcharged turns
this ordinary process—which is not wholly
unknown at home—into a bitter grievance.
To hear him expatiate upon the subject, one
might imagine that his fellow creatures had
heretofore supplied all his wants for love.</p>

<p>Great Britain had sent her restless children
out to see the world for many years before faraway
America joined in the sport, while the
overwhelming increase of German travellers
dates only from the Franco-Prussian War.
Now the three armies of occupation march and
countermarch over the Continent, very much in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
one another’s way, and deeply resentful of one
another’s intrusion. “The English”—again
I venture to quote Froissart—“are affable to
no other nation than their own.” The Americans—so

<p class="center">

</p>

<p class="in0">All these unlovely characteristics are stimulated
and kept well to the fore by travel. It is
only in our fellow tourists that we can recognize
their enormity. When Mr. Arnold said
that Shakespeare and Virgil would have found
the Pilgrim Fathers “intolerable company,”
he was probably thinking of poets and pietists
shut up together in fair weather and in foul,
while the little Mayflower pitched its slow way
across the “estranging sea.”</p>

<p>It requires a good deal of courage to quote
Lord Chesterfield seriously in these years of
grace. His reasonableness is out of favour
with moralists, and sentimentalists, and earnest
thinkers generally. But we might find it helpful
now and then, were we not too wrapped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
in self-esteem to be so easily helped. “Good
breeding,” he says thoughtfully, “is a combination
of much sense, some good nature, and
a little self-denial for the sake of others, with a
view to obtain the same indulgence from them.”
Here is a “Tourist’s Guide,”—the briefest
ever penned. We cannot learn to love other
tourists,—the laws of nature forbid it,—but,
meditating soberly on the impossibility of their
loving us, we may reach some common platform
of tolerance, some common exchange of recognition
and amenity.</p>

<p class="b0" lang="fr">Et cependant, toute grandeur, toute puissance, toute
subordination repose sur l’exécuteur: il est l’horreur et
le lien de l’association humaine. Otez du monde cet agent
incompréhensible; dans l’instant même l’ordre fait place
au chaos, les trônes s’abîment, et la société disparaît.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Joseph de Maistre.</span>
</p>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">What</span> a sombre and striking figure in the
deeply coloured background of history is the
headsman, that passive agent of strange tyrannies,
that masked executor of laws which were
often but the expression of man’s violence! He
stands aloof from the brilliant web of life, yet,
turn where we will, his shadow falls across
the scene. In the little walled towns of mediæval
Europe, in the splendid cities, in the
broad lands held by feudal lord or stately monastery,
wherever the struggle for freedom and
power was sharpest and sternest, the headsman
played his part. An unreasoning and richly
imaginative fear wrapped him in a mantle of
romance, as deeply stained as the scarlet cloak<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
which was his badge of office. Banished from
the cheerful society of men (de Maistre tells
us that if other houses surrounded his abode,
they were deserted, and left to crumble and
decay), he enjoyed privileges that compensated
him for his isolation. His tithes were
exacted as ruthlessly as were those of prince
or baron; and if his wife chattered little
on summer days with friendly gossips, she was
sought in secret after nightfall for hideous
amulets that blessed—or cursed—the wearer.
From father to son, from son to grandson,
the right was handed down; and the young
boy was taught to lift and swing the heavy
sword, that his hand might be as sure as his
eye, his muscles as hard as his heart.</p>

<p>Much of life’s brilliant panorama was seen
from the elevation of the scaffold in the days
when men had no chance nor leisure to die
lingeringly in their beds. They fell fighting,
or by the assassin’s hand, or by the help of
what was then termed law; and the headsman,
standing ever ready for his rôle, beheld human
nature in its worst and noblest aspects,
in moments of stern endurance and supreme<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
emotion, of heroic ecstasy and blank despair.
Had he a turn for the marvellous, it was gratified.
He saw Saint Denis arise and carry his
severed head from Montmartre to the site of
the church which bears his name to-day. He
saw Saint Felix and Saint Alban repeat
the miracle. He heard Lucretia of Ancona
pronounce the sacred name three times after
decapitation. Ordericus Vitalis, that most engaging
of historians, tells us the story of the
fair Lucretia; and also of the Count de Galles,
who asked upon the scaffold for time in which
to say his <i lang="la">Pater Noster</i>. When he reached
the words, <i lang="fr">Et ne nos inducas in tentationem</i>,
the headsman—all unworthy of his office—grew
impatient, and brought down his shining
sword. The Count’s head rolled on the ground,
but from his open lips came with terrible distinctness
the final supplication, <i lang="la">Sed libera nos
a malo</i>.</p>

<p>These were not trivial experiences. What a
tale to tell o’ nights was that of Théodoric
Schawembourg, whose headless trunk arose
and walked thirty paces from the block! Auberive,
who has preserved this famous legend,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
embroiders it with so many fantastic details
that the salient point of the narrative is well-nigh
lost; but the dead and forgotten headsman
beheld the deed in all its crude simplicity.
Had he, on the other hand, a taste for experimental
science, it was given him to watch the
surgeons of Prague, who in 1679 replaced a
severed head upon a young criminal’s shoulders,
and kept the lad alive for half an hour. Panurge,
it will be remembered, was permanently
successful in a similar operation; but Panurge
was a man of genius. We should hardly expect
to find his like among the doctors of Prague.</p>

<p>Strange and unreasonable laws guaranteed
to the headsman his full share of emoluments.
He was well paid for his work, and never suffered
from a dull season. From the towns he
received poultry and fodder, from the monasteries,
fish and game. The Abbaye de Saint-Germain
gave him every year a pig’s head;
the Abbaye de Saint-Martin five loaves of
bread and five bottles of wine. Cakes were
baked for him on the eve of Epiphany. From
each leper in the community he exacted—Heaven
knows why!—a tax at Christmastime.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
<i lang="fr">Les filles de joie</i> were his vassals, and
paid him tribute. He had the power to save
from death any woman on her way to the scaffold,
provided he were able and willing to marry
her. He was the first official summoned to the
body of a suicide; and standing on the dead
man’s breast, he claimed as his own everything
he could touch with the point of his long sword.
He might, if he chose, arrest the little pigs that
strayed in freedom through the streets of Paris,—like
the happy Plantagenet pigs of London,—and
carry them as prisoners to the Hôtel
Dieu. Here, unless it could be shown that
they belonged to the monks of Saint Anthony,
and so, for the sake of the good pig that loved
the blessed hermit, were free from molestation,
their captor demanded their heads, or a fine of
five sous for every ransomed innocent. It was
his privilege to snatch in the market-place as
much corn as he could carry away in his hands,
and the peasants thus freely robbed submitted
without a murmur, crossing themselves with
fervour as he passed. The representative of law
and order was not unlike a licensed libertine
in the easy day of old.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span></p>

<p>The element of picturesqueness entered into
this life, sombre traditions enriched it, terror
steeped it in gloom, the power for which it
stood lent to it dignity and weight. In Spain
the headsman wore a distinctive dress, and his
house was painted a deep and ominous red.
In France the ancient title “<i lang="fr">Exécuteur de la
haute justice</i>” had a full-blown majesty of
sound. In Germany superstition grew like a
fungus beneath the scaffold’s shade, until even
the sword was believed to be a sentient thing
with strange powers of its own. Who can
forget the story of the child Annerl, whose
mother took her to the headsman’s house,
whereupon the great weapon stirred uneasily
in its cupboard, thirsting for her blood. Then
the headsman besought the mother to allow
him to cut the little girl very lightly, that the
sword might be appeased; but she shudderingly
refused, and Annerl, abandoned to her
destiny, was led thirty years later to the block.
Executions at night were long in favour, and by
the flare of torches the scaffold stood revealed
to a great and gaping crowd. For centuries <i lang="fr">la
place de Grève</i> was the theatre for this ghastly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
drama, until every foot of the soil was saturated
with blood. Only in 1633 were these
torchlight decapitations forbidden throughout
France. They had grown too turbulently entertaining.</p>

<p>The headsman’s office was hereditary, and if
there were no sons, a son-in-law succeeded to the
post. Henri Sanson, the last of his dread name,
claimed that he was of good blood, and that
the far-off ancestor who handed down his sword
to nine generations had been betrayed by love
to this dark destiny. He had married a headsman’s
daughter, and could not escape the terrible
dowry she brought him. It is not possible
to attach much weight to the Sanson memoirs,—they
are so plainly apocryphal; but we know
that the family plied its craft for nearly two
hundred years, and that one woman of the race
bore seven sons, who all became executioners.
In 1726 Charles Sanson died, leaving a little
boy, Jean Baptiste, only seven years old. Upon
him devolved his father’s office; but, in view
of his tender infancy, an assistant was appointed
to do the work until he came of age.
It was required, however, that the child should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
stand upon the scaffold at every execution,
sanctioning it with his presence.</p>

<p>The pride of the headsman lay in his dexterity.
The sword was heavy, the stroke was
sure. Capeluche, who during the furious struggle
between the Armagnacs and the Burgundians
severed many a noble head, was a
true enthusiast, practising his art <i lang="it">con amore</i>,
and with incredible delicacy and skill. When
the fortunes of war brought him in turn upon
the scaffold, he proved no craven; but took
a lively and intelligent interest in his own
decapitation. His last moments were spent in
giving a practical lesson to the executioner;
showing him where to stand, where to place
the block, and how best to handle his weapon.</p>

<p>The vast audience that assembled so often to
witness a drama never staled by repetition was
wont to be exceedingly critical. Bungling work
drew down upon the headsman the execrations
of the mob, and not infrequently placed his
own life in danger. De Thou’s head fell only
at the eleventh stroke, the Duke of Monmouth
was mangled piteously, and in both these instances
the fury of the mob rose to murder<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
point. It was ostensibly to save such sufferings
and such scenes that the guillotine was
adopted in France; but for the guillotine it is
impossible to cherish any sentiment save abhorrence.
Vile, vulgar, and brutalizing, its
only merit was the hideous speed with which it
did its work; a speed which the despots of the
Terror never found fast enough. In October,
1792, twenty-one Girondists were beheaded in
thirty-one minutes; but as practice made perfect,
these figures were soon outdistanced. The
highest record reached was sixty-two decapitations
in forty-five minutes, which sounds like
the work of the shambles.</p>

<p>Charles Henri Sanson, the presiding genius
of the guillotine, has been lifted to notoriety
by the torrents of blood he shed; but his is
a contemptible figure, without any of the dark
distinction that marked his predecessors. His
pages of the family memoirs are probably
mendacious, and certainly, as M. Loye pathetically
laments, “insipid.” He poses as a
physiologist, and tells strange tales of the
condemned who long survived beheading, as
though sixty-two executions in forty-five<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
minutes left leisure for the study of such
phenomena. He also affects the tone of a philanthropist,
commiserates the king who died by
his hands, and is careful to assure us that it
was an assistant named Legros who, holding
up the severed head of Charlotte Corday,
struck the fair cheek which blushed beneath
the blow. We are even asked to believe that
he, Sanson, whispered to Marie Antoinette
as she descended from the cart, “Have
courage, Madame!”—counsel of which that
daughter of the Cæsars stood in little need.</p>

<p>The contrast is sharp between this business-like
butchery, where the condemned were begrudged
the time it took to die, and the earlier
executions, so full of dignity and composure.
The vilest criminals felt intuitively that the
fulness of their atonement consecrated those
last sad moments, and behaved often with unexpected
propriety and grace. Mme. de Brinvilliers
was a full half hour upon the scaffold.
The headsman prepared her for death, untying
her cap-strings, cutting off her hair, baring her
shoulders, and binding her hands. She was
composed without bravado, contrite without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
sanctimoniousness. “I doubt,” wrote her confessor,
the Abbé Piron, “whether in all her
life she had ever been so patient under the
hands of her maid.” Some natural scorn she
expressed at sight of the crowd straining with
curiosity to see her die: “<span lang="fr">Un beau spectacle,
Mesdames et Messieurs!</span>”—but this was all.
The executioner swept off her head with one
swift stroke; then, hastily opening a flask,
took a deep draught of wine. “That was a
good blow,” he said to the Abbé. “At these
times I always recommend myself to God, and
He has never failed me. This lady has been
on my mind for a week past. I will have six
Masses said for her soul.” Surely such a
headsman ennobled in some degree the direful
post he bore.</p>

<p>If a murderess, inconceivably callous and
cruel, could die with dignity, what of the
countless scenes where innocence was sacrificed
to ambition, and where the best and
noblest blood of Europe was shed upon the
block? What of the death of Conradin on a
Neapolitan scaffold? In the thirteenth century,
boys grew quickly into manhood, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
Conradin was seventeen. He had embarked
early upon that desperate game, of which the
prize was a throne, and the forfeit, life. He
had missed his throw, and earned his penalty.
But he was the grandson of an emperor, the
heir of an imperial crown, and the last of a
proud race. There was a pathetic boyishness
in the sudden defiance with which he hurled
his glove into the throng, and in the low murmur
of his mother’s name. The headsman had
a bitter part to play that day, for Conradin’s
death is one of the world’s tragedies; but
there are other scaffolds upon which we still
glance back with a pity fresh enough for pain.
When Count Egmont and Admiral Horn were
beheaded in the great square of Brussels,
the executioner wisely hid beneath the black
draperies until it was time for him to do his
work. He had no wish to parade himself as
part of that sad show.</p>

<p>In England the rules of etiquette were
never more binding than upon those who were
about to be beheaded. When the Duke of
Hamilton, the Earl of Holland, and Lord
Capel went to the block together, they were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
told they must die in the order of their rank,
as though they were going in to dinner; and
upon Lord Capel’s offering to address the
crowd without removing his hat, it was explained
to him that this was incorrect. The
scaffold was not the House of Parliament, and
those who graced it were expected to uncover.
On a later and very memorable occasion, the
Earl of Kilmarnock, “with a most just mixture
of dignity and submission,” offered the melancholy
precedence to Lord Balmerino. That
gallant soldier—“a natural, brave old gentleman,”
says Horace Walpole, though he was but
fifty-eight—would have mounted first, but the
headsman interfered. Even upon the scaffold,
a belted earl enjoyed the privileges of his rank.</p>

<p>All this formality must have damped the
spirits of the condemned; but it seems to have
been borne with admirable gayety and good
temper. Lord Balmerino, “decently unmoved,”
was ready to die first or last, and he gave the
punctilious executioner three guineas, to prove
that he was not impatient. “He looked quite
unconcerned,” says an eye-witness, “and like
some one going on a party of pleasure, or upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
some business of little or no importance.” Lord
Lovat, beheaded at eighty for his active share
in the Jacobite rising of ‘forty-five, derived
much amusement from the vast concourse of
people assembled to witness his execution;—an
amusement agreeably intensified by the
giving way of some scaffolding, which occasioned
the unexpected death of several eager
sight-seers. “The more mischief, the better
sport,” said the old lord grimly, and proceeded
to quote Ovid and Horace with fine scholarly
zest. If the executioner were seldom a person
of education, it was from no lack of opportunity.
He might, had he chosen, have learned
at his post much law and more theology. When
Archbishop Laud stood waiting by the block,
Sir John Clotworthy conceived it to be a seasonable
occasion for propounding some knotty
points of doctrine. The prelate courteously
answered one or two questions, but time pressed,
and controversy had lost its charms. Even so
good a churchman may be pardoned for turning
wearily away from polemics, when his life’s
span had narrowed down to minutes, and the
headsman waited by his side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span></p>

<p>In the burial registry of Whitechapel, under
the year 1649, is the following <span class="locked">entry:—</span></p>

<p>“June 21st, Richard Brandon, a man out
of Rosemary Lane. This Brandon is held to
be the man who beheaded Charles the First.”</p>

<p>“Held to be” only, for the mystery of the
King’s executioner was one which long excited
and baffled curiosity. Wild whispers credited
the deed to men of rank and station, among
them Viscount Stair, the type of strategist to
whom all manner of odium naturally and reasonably
clings. A less distinguished candidate
for the infamy was one William Hewlett,
actually condemned to death after the Restoration
for a part he never played, and saved from
the gallows only by the urgent efforts of a few
citizens who swore that Brandon did the deed.
Brandon was not available for retribution. He
had died in his bed, five months after Charles
was beheaded, and had been hurried ignominiously
into his grave in Whitechapel churchyard.
As public executioner of London, he
could hardly escape his destiny; but it is said
that remorse and horror shortened his life. In
his supposed “Confession,” a tract widely circulated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
at the time, he claimed that he was
“fetched out of bed by a troup of horse,” and
carried against his will to the scaffold. Also
that he was paid thirty pounds, all in half-crowns,
for the work; and had “an orange
stuck full of cloves, and a handkerchief out
of the King’s pocket.” The orange he sold for
ten shillings in Rosemary Lane.</p>

<p>The shadow that falls across the headsman’s
path deepens in horror when we contemplate
the scaffolds of Charles, of Louis, of Marie
Antoinette, and of Mary Stuart. The hand
that has shed royal blood is stained forever, yet
the very magnitude of the offence lends to it a
painful and terrible distinction. It is the zenith
as well as the nadir of the headsman’s history;
it is the corner-stone of the impassable barrier
which divides the axe and the sword from the
hangman’s noose, the death of Strafford from
the death of Jonathan Wild.</p>

<p>If we turn the page, and look for a moment
at the “gallows tree,” we find that it has its
romantic and its comic side, but the comedy is
boisterous, the romance savours of melodrama.
For centuries one of the recognized amusements<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
of the English people was to see men
hanged, and the leading features of the entertainment
were modified from time to time to
please a popular taste. Dr. Johnson, the sanest
as well as the best man of his day, highly
commended these public executions as “satisfactory
to all parties. The public is gratified
by a procession, the criminal is supported by
it.” That the enjoyment was often mutual, it
is impossible to deny. There was a world of
meaning in the gentle custom, supported for
years by a very ancient benefaction, of giving
a nosegay to the condemned man on his way
to Tyburn. Before the cart climbed Holborn
Hill,—“the heavy hill” as it was called,
with a touch of poetry rivalling the “Bridge
of Sighs,”—it stopped at Saint Sepulchre’s
church, and on the church steps stood one
bearing in his hands the flowers that were to
yield their fresh fragrance to the dying. Nor
were the candidates without their modest pride.
When the noted chimney-sweep, Sam Hall,
achieved the honour of a hanging, he was
rudely jostled, and bidden to stand off by a
highwayman, stepping haughtily into the cart,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
and annoyed at finding himself in such low
company. “Stand off, yourself!” was the indignant
answer of the young sweep. “I have
as good a right to be here as you have.”</p>

<p>“Nothing,” says Voltaire, “is so disagreeable
as to be obscurely hanged,” and the loneliness
which in this moral age encompasses
the felon’s last hours should be as salutary
as it is depressing. Mr. Housman, who gets
closer to the plain thoughts of plain men than
any poet of modern times, has given stern
expression to the awful aloofness of the condemned
criminal from his fellow creatures, an
aloofness unknown in the cheerful, brutal days
of old.</p>

<p>The sociability of Tyburn, if somewhat
vehement in character, was a jocund thing by
the side of such solitude as this.</p>

<p>Parish registers make curious reading.
They tell so much in words so scant and bald
that they set us wondering on our own accounts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
over the unknown details of tragedies
which even in their day won no wide hearing,
and which have been wholly forgotten for centuries.
Mr. Lang quotes two entries that are
briefly comprehensive; the first from the register
of Saint Nicholas, Durham, August 8,
1592: “Simson, Arington, Featherston, Fenwick,
and Lancaster, were hanged for being
Egyptians.”</p>

<p>Featherston and Fenwick might have been
hanged on the evidence of their names, good
gypsy names both of them, and famous for
years in the dark annals of the race; but
were these men guilty of no other crime, no
indiscretion even, that has escaped recording?
Five stalwart rogues might have served the
queen in better fashion than by dangling idly
on a gallows. The second entry, from the parish
church of Richmond in Yorkshire, 1558, is
still shorter, a model of conciseness: “Richard
Snell b’rnt, bur. 9 Sept.”</p>

<p>Was Snell a martyr, unglorified by Fox, or
a particularly desperate sinner; and if a sinner,
what was the nature of his sin? Warlocks
were commonly hanged in the sixteenth century,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
even when their sister witches were
burned. “<i lang="fr">C’est la loi de l’homme.</i>” In fact,
burning was an unusual, and—save in Queen
Mary’s mind—an unpopular mode of punishment.
“You are burnt for heresy,” says Mr.
Birrell with great good humour. “That is
right enough. No one would complain of that.
Hanging is a different matter. It is very easy
to get hung; but to be burnt requires a combination
of circumstances not always forthcoming.”</p>

<p>Yet Richard Snell, yeoman of Yorkshire,
mastered these circumstances; and a single
line in a parish register is his meagre share of
fame.</p>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">Not</span> long ago I saw these lines quoted to show
the blessedness of sanctuary; quoted with a
serious sentimentality which left no room for
their more startling significance. The writer
drew a parallel between the ruffian sheltered by
his church and the soldier sheltered by his
flag, forgiven much wrong-doing for the sake
of the standard under which he has served and
suffered. But Mr. Browning’s murderer has
not served the church. He is unforgiven, and,
let us hope, eventually hanged. In the interval,
however, he poses as a hero to the children,
and as an object of lively interest to the
pious and Mass-going Florentines. A lean
monk praying on the altar steps would have
awakened no sentiment in their hearts; yet
even the frequency, the cheapness of crime<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>

still hangs about historic sins, making them—as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
Plutarch knew—more attractive than historic
virtues. Places consecrated to the memory
of crime have so keen an interest that travellers
search for them painstakingly, and are
often both grieved and indignant because some
blood-soaked hovel has not been carefully preserved
by the ungrateful community which
harboured—and hanged—the wretch who
lived in it. I met in Edinburgh a disappointed
tourist,—a woman and an American,—who
had spent a long day searching vainly for the
house in which Burke and Hare committed
their ghastly murders, and for the still more
hideous habitation of Major Weir and his
sister. She had wandered for hours through
the most offensive slums that Great Britain
has to show; she had seen and heard and smelt
everything that was disagreeable; she had
made endless inquiries, and had been regarded
as a troublesome lunatic; and all that she
might look upon the dilapidated walls, behind
which had been committed evils too vile for
telling. And this in Edinburgh, the city of
great and sombre tragedies, where Mary Stuart
held her court, and Montrose rode to the scaffold.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
With so many dark pages in her chronicles,
one has scant need to burrow for ignoble
guilt.</p>

<p>There are deeds, however, that have so coloured
history, stained it so redly and so imperishably,
that their seal is set upon the abodes
that witnessed them, and all other associations
grow dim and trivial by comparison. The
murder of a Douglas or of a Guise by his
sovereign is the apotheosis of crime, the zenith
of horror. As long as the stones of Stirling or
of Blois shall hold together, that horror shall be
their dower. The walls shriek their tale. They
make a splendid and harmonious background
for the tragedy that gives them life. They are
fitting guardians of their fame. It can never
be sufficiently regretted that the murder of
Darnley had so mean a setting, and that the
methods employed by the murderers have left
us little even of that meanness. Some bleak
fortress in the north should have sheltered
a crime so long impending, and so grimly
wrought; but perhaps the paltriness of the
victim merited no better <i lang="fr">mise en scène</i>. The
Douglas and the Guise were made of sterner<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
stuff, and the world—the tourist world—pays
in its vapouring fashion a tribute to their
strength. It buys pathetically incongruous souvenirs
of the “Douglas room;” and it traces
every step by which the great Duke, the head
and the heart of the League, went scornfully
to his death.</p>

<p>Blois <em>has</em> associations that are not murderous.
It saw the solemn consecration of the
standard of Joan of Arc, and the splendid feasts
which celebrated the auspicious betrothal of
Henry of Navarre to his Valois bride. The
statue of Louis the Twelfth, “Father of his people,”
sits stiffly astride of its caparisoned charger
above the entrance gate. But it is not upon
Joan, nor upon Navarre, nor upon good King
Louis that the traveller wastes a thought. The
ghosts that dominate the château are those of
Catherine de Medici, of her son, wanton in
wickedness, and of the murdered Guise. Castle
guides are notoriously short of speech, sparing
of time, models of bored indifference. But the
guardian of Blois waxes eloquent over the tale
he has to tell, and, with the dramatic instinct
of his race, strives to put its details vividly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
before our eyes. He assigns to each assassin
his post, shows where the wretched young king
concealed himself until the deed was done, and
points out the exact spot in the Cabinet Vieux
where the first blow was struck. “Behold the
perfect tableau!” he winds up enthusiastically,
and we are forced to admit that, as a tableau,
it lacks no element of success. Mr. Henry
James’s somewhat cynical appreciation of this
“perfect episode”—perfect, from the dramatist’s
point of view—recurs inevitably to our
<span class="locked">minds:—</span></p>

<p>“The picture is full of light and darkness,
full of movement, full altogether of abominations.
Mixed up with them all is the great
theological motive, so that the drama wants
little to make it complete. The insolent prosperity
of the victim; the weakness, the vices,
the terrors of the author of the deed; the
admirable execution of the plot; the accumulation
of horror in what followed,—render it,
as a crime, one of the classic things.”</p>

<p>Classic surely were the repeated warnings,
so determinedly ignored. Cæsar was not more
plainly cautioned of his danger than was the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
Duke of Guise. Cæsar was not more resolved
to live his life fearlessly, or to die. Cæsar was
not harder to kill. It takes many a dagger
stroke to release a strong spirit from its
clay.</p>

<p>There were dismal prophecies months ahead,
advance couriers of the slowly maturing plot.
“Before the year dies, you shall die,” was the
message sent to the Duke when the States-General
were summoned to Blois. His mother,
ceaselessly apprehensive, his mistress, Charlotte
de Sauves, besought him to leave the château.
Nine ominous notes, crumpled bits of paper,
each written at the peril of a life, admonished
him of his fate. The ninth was thrust into his
hand as he made his way for the last time to
the council chamber. “<i lang="fr">Le ciel sombre et
triste</i>” frowned forebodingly upon him as he
crossed the terrace, and La Salle and D’Aubercourt
strove even then to turn him back. At
the foot of the beautiful spiral staircase sat the
jester, Chicot, singing softly under his breath
a final word of warning, “<i lang="fr">Hé, j’ay Guise.</i>” He
dared no more, and he dared that much in
vain. The Duke passed him disdainfully, and—smitten<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
by the gods with madness—went
lightly up the steps to meet his doom.</p>

<p>This is the story that Blois has to tell, and
she tells it with terrible distinctness. She is so
steeped in blood, so shadowed by the memory
of her crime, that there is scant need for her
guides to play their official parts, nor for her
museum walls to be hung round with feeble representations
of the tragedy. But it is strange,
after all, that the beautiful home of Francis the
First should not speak to us more audibly of
him. He built its right wing, “the most joyous
utterance of the French Renaissance.” He
stamped his own exuberant gayety upon every
detail. His salamander curls its carven tail over
stairs and doors and window sills. He is surely
a figure striking enough, and familiar enough to
enchain attention. Why do we not think about
him, and about those ladies of “mutable connections”
whose names echo buoyantly from his
little page of history? Why do our minds turn
obstinately to the Cabinet Vieux, or to those
still more mirthless rooms above where Catherine
de Medici lived and died. “<i lang="fr">Il y a de
méchantes qualités qui font de grandes talents</i>,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
but these qualities were noticeably lacking
in the Queen Mother. It is not the good
she tried and failed to do, but the evil that she
wrought which gives her a claim to our magnetized
interest and regard.</p>

<p>To the tolerant observer it seems a work of
supererogation, a gilding of refined gold, to add
to the sins of really accomplished sinners like
Catherine and Louis the Eleventh. These
sombre souls have left scant space for our riotous
imaginations to fill in. Their known deeds
are terrible enough to make us quail. It might
be more profitable—as it is certainly more irksome—to
search for their redeeming traits:
the tact, the mental vigour of the queen,
and the efforts she made to bind together the
distracted factions of France; the courage,
sagacity, and unflinching resolution with which
Louis strengthened his kingdom, and protected
those whose mean estate made them wholly uninteresting
to nobler monarchs. These things are
worth consideration, but far be it from us to
consider them. High lights and heavy shadows
please us best; and by this time the shadows
have been so well inked that their blackness is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
impenetrable. It can never be said of Catherine
de Medici, as it is said of Mary Stuart,
that she has been injured by the zeal of her
friends, and helped by the falsehoods of her
enemies. Catherine has few friends, and none
whose enthusiasm is burdensome to bear. She
has furnished easily-used material for writers
of romance, who commonly represent her as
depopulating France with poisoned gloves and
perfumery; and she has served as a target—too
big to be missed—for tyros in historical
invective. We have come to regard her in a
large, loose, picturesque way as an embodiment
of evil,—very much, perhaps, as Mr. John
Addington Symonds regards Clytemnestra,—fed
and nourished by her sins, waxing fat upon
iniquity, and destitute alike of conscience and
of shame. And this is the reason that women
who have spent their lives in the practice of
laborious virtues stand fluttering with delight
in that dark Medicean bedchamber. “Blois is
the most interesting of all the châteaux,” said
one of them to me;—she looked as if she
could not even tell a lie;—“you see the very
bed in which Catherine de Medici died.” And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>
I thought of the Florentine children at the
altar steps.</p>

<p>Mr. Andrew Lang is of the opinion that if
an historical event could be discredited, like a
ghost story, by discrepancies in the evidence,
we might maintain that Darnley was never murdered
at all. We might also be led to doubt
the existence of Cardinal Balue’s cage, that
ingenious torture-chamber which has added so
largely and so deservedly to the reputation
of Louis the Eleventh. There is a drawing
of the cage, or rather of <em>a</em> cage, still to be
seen, and there is the bill for its making;—what
a prop to history are well-kept household
accounts!—while, on the other hand, its ubiquitous
nature staggers our trusting faith.
Loches claims it as one of her traditions, and
so does Plessis-les-Tours. Loches is so rich in
horrors that she can afford to dispense with
a few; but the cage, if it ever existed at all,
was undoubtedly one of the permanent decorations
of her tower. The room in which it hung
is cheerful and commodious when compared to
the black prison of Saint Valier, or to the still
deeper dungeon of the Bishops of Puy and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
Autun. The cardinal could at least see and be
seen, if that were any amelioration of his lot,
and we are still shown the turret stairs down
which the king stepped warily when he came
to visit his prisoner.</p>

<p>But Plessis-les-Tours covets the distinction
of the cage. She is not without some dismal
memories of her own, though she looks like a
dismantled factory, and she strives with pardonable
ambition to make them dismaler. The
energetic and intelligent woman who conducts
visitors around her mouldering walls has, in a
splendid spirit of assurance, selected for this
purpose a small dilapidated cellar, open to the
sky, and a small dilapidated flight of steps, not
more than seven in number. Beneath these
steps—where a terrier might perhaps curl
himself in comfort—she assured us with an
unflinching front the cardinal’s cage was tucked;
and reading the doubt in our veiled eyes, she
stooped and pointed out a rusty bit of iron
riveted in the wall. “See,” she said triumphantly,
“there still remains one of the fastenings
of the cage.” The argument was irresistible:</p>

<p class="center">
Behold this Walrus tooth.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span></p>

<p>The fact is that it has been found necessary
to exert a great deal of ingenuity in order to
meet the popular demand for cold-blooded
cruelty where Louis the Eleventh is concerned.
He is an historic bugbear, a hobgoblin, at
whose grim ghost we grown-up children like to
shudder apprehensively. Scott, with a tolerance
as wide as Shakespeare’s own, has dared
to give a finer colour to the picture, has dared
to engage our sympathy for this implacable old
man who knew how to “hate and wait,” how
to lie in ambush, and how to drive relentlessly
to his goal. But even Scott has been unable to
subdue our cherished antipathy, or to modify
the deep prejudices instilled early into our
minds. Mr. Robert Louis Stevenson, who of
all writers has least patience with schoolbook
verdicts, hits hard at our narrow fidelity to
censorship. “It is probably more instructive,”
he says, “to entertain a sneaking kindness for
any unpopular person than to give way to
perfect raptures of moral indignation against
his abstract vices.”</p>

<p>Now a more unpopular, a more comprehensively
unlovable person than Louis it would be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
hard to find. He did much for France, yet
France drew a deep breath of relief when he
died.</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">Quy de son peple n’est pas amez.</div>

</div>

<p class="in0">Those who fail to entertain the “sneaking
kindness” recommended by Mr. Stevenson may
shelter themselves behind this ancient couplet.
“Of him there is an end. God pardon him his
sins,” is Froissart’s fashion of summing up
every man’s career. It will serve as well for
Louis as for another.</p>

<p>But to gratify at once our prejudices and
our emotions, a generous mass of legend has
been added to the chronicles of Loches, Blois,
Amboise, and other castles that are consecrated
to the crimes of kings. History, though flexible
and complaisant up to a certain point, has
her limits of accommodation. She has also her
cold white lights, and her disconcerting truths,
so annoying, and so invariably ill-timed in their
revelations. We can never be quite sure that
History, however obliging she seems, will not
suddenly desert our rightful cause, and go over
to our opponents. We have but to remember<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
what trouble she has given, and in what an invidious,
not to say churlish spirit she has contradicted
the most masterly historians. It is
best to ignore her altogether, and to tell our
stories without any reference to her signature.</p>

<p>So thought the sensible young woman who
led us captive through the collegiate church
at Loches, and who insisted upon our descending
into the crypt, at one time connected with
the fortress by a subterranean gallery. Its
dim walls are decorated here and there with
mural paintings, rude and half effaced. She
pointed out the shadowy outline of a saint in
cope and mitre, his stiff forefinger raised in
benediction. “That,” she said with startling
composure, “is the bishop who was the confessor
of Louis the Eleventh. The king had him
buried alive in this chapel, so that he might
not betray the secrets of his confession.”</p>

<p>“And did the king have him painted on the
wall afterwards, to commemorate the circumstance?”
asked the scoffer of the party, at
whom others gazed reproachfully, while I wondered
how the story of Saint John of Nepomuk
had travelled so far afield, and why it had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
been so absurdly reset to add another shade to
Louis’s memory. It hardly seemed worth while,
in view of the legitimate darkness of the horizon.
It even seemed a pity. It forced a laugh,
and laughter is inharmonious beneath the walls
of Loches. But if the king, whose piety was of
a vigorous and active order, had the habit
of walling up his confessors, there must have
been some rational hesitation on the part of
even the most devoted clerics when his Majesty
sought to be shriven; and the stress of royal
conscientiousness—combined with royal apprehension—must
have shortened the somewhat
hazardous road to church preferment. The fact
that Louis never wasted his cruelties, that they
were one and all the fruits of deep and secret
hostility, might have saved him from being the
hero of such fantastic myths.</p>

<p>It was more amusing to visit the picturesque
old house in Tours, known as <span class="sans">le Maison de
Tristan l’Ermite</span>. How it came to be associated
with that melancholy and industrious
hangman, who had been dead half a century
when its first stone was laid, has never been
made clear; unless, indeed, the familiar device<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
of the festooned cord, the emblem of Anne de
Bretagne, which is carved over door and windows,
may be held responsible for the suggestion.
Once christened, however, it has become
a centre of finely imaginative romance,—romance
of a high order, which for finish of
detail may be recommended to the careless
purveyors of historic fiction. Passing through
the heavy doorway into a beautiful sombre
courtyard, we had hardly time to admire its
proportions, and the curious little stone beasts
which wanton wickedly in dark corners, before
a gaunt woman, who is the guardian spirit of
the place, summoned us to ascend an interminable
flight of steps, much worn and dimly lit.
They had an ominous look, and the woman’s
air of mystery, subtly blent with resolution, was
in admirable accord with her surroundings.
From time to time she paused to point out a
shallow niche which had formerly held a lamp,
or a broken place in the wall’s rough masonry.
“<i lang="fr">L’oubliette</i>,” she whispered grimly, pointing
to the hole which revealed—and gainsaid—nothing.
There was a small walled-up door,
equally reserved, which she said was, or had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>
been, the opening of a secret passage connecting
the house with the château of Plessis-les-Tours,
more than two miles away. The full
significance of this remark failed to dawn
upon us until we had climbed up, up, up, and
emerged at last upon a narrow balcony overlooking
the sad courtyard far below, and protected
by a heavy iron railing. It was a disagreeable
place, not without its suggestions of
horror; yet were we in no wise prepared for
the recital that followed. From this railing,
said our guide, Tristan l’Ermite was in the
habit of hanging the victims whom Louis the
Eleventh, “that great and prompt chastener,”
confided to his mercy. I could not help murmuring
at the cruelty which compelled the unfortunates
to mount nearly two hundred steps
to be hanged, when the courtyard beneath
offered every reasonable accommodation; but,
even as I spoke, I recognized the poverty of
imagination which could prompt such a stupid
speech. Perhaps some direful memory of the
<i lang="fr">Balcon des Conjures</i> at Amboise may be held
responsible for the web of fiction which has
been woven about this grim eyrie of Tours;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>
and if the picture lacks the magnificent setting
of the Amboise tragedy, it is by no means
destitute of power. There is a certain grandeur
in being hanged from such a dizzy height.</p>

<p>Our guide next pointed out the opening of
the mythical oubliette. If the condemned toiled
wearily up to their beetling scaffold, the executioners
were spared at least the labour of
carrying their bodies down again. After they
had been picturesquely hanged under the king’s
own eye,—for we were asked to believe that
Louis walked two miles along a subterranean
passage to inspect the ordinary, and by no
means infrequent, processes of justice,—the
corpses were tumbled into the oubliette, and
made their own headlong way to the Loire.</p>

<p>One more detail was added to this interesting
and deeply coloured fable. The right-hand wall
of the courtyard was studded, on a level with
the balcony, with huge rusty iron nails. There
were rows upon rows of these unlovely and
apparently useless objects which tradition had
not failed to turn to good account. For every
man hanged on that spot by the indefatigable
Tristan, a nail was, it seems, driven into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
wall, which thus became a sort of baker’s tally
or tavern slate. We counted forty-four nails.
The woman nodded her head with serious
satisfaction. Frequent repetitions of her story
had brought her almost to the point of believing
it. She had ministered so long to the tastes
of tourists—who like to think that Louis
hanged his subjects as liberally as Catherine
de Medici poisoned hers—that she had
gradually moulded her narrative into symmetry,
making use of every available feature to give
it consistency and grace. The fine old house—which
may have harboured tragedies of its
own as sombre as any wrought by Tristan’s
hand—lent itself with true architectural sympathy
to the illusion. Some habitations can do
this thing, can look to perfection the parts assigned
them by history or by tradition. Who
that has ever seen the “Jew’s House” at Lincoln
can forget the peculiar horror that broods
over the dark, ill-omened doorway? The place
is peopled by ghosts. Beneath its heavy lintel
pass little trembling feet. From out the shadows
comes a strangled cry. It tells its tale
better than Chaucer or the balladists; with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
less pity and more fear, less detail and more
suggestiveness. We shudder as we peer into
its gloom, yet we linger, magnetized by the
subtlety of association. It may be innocent,—poor,
huddled mass of stone,—but we hope
not. We are like the children at the altar-foot,
spellbound by the vision of a crime.</p>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">In</span> these Wordsworthian lines Shelley describes
Lord Byron’s little daughter, Allegra, then
under two years of age; and the word “toy”—so
keenly suggestive of both the poetic and
the masculine point of view—has in this case
an unconscious and bitter significance. Allegra
was a toy at which rude hands plucked violently,
until death lifted her from their clutches,
and hid her away in the safety and dignity
of the tomb. “She is more fortunate than we
are,” said her father, with a noble and rare
lapse into simplicity, and the words were sadly
true. Never did a little child make a happier
escape from the troublesome burden of life.</p>

<p>In the winter of 1816, a handsome, vivacious,
dark-eyed girl sought the acquaintance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>
of Lord Byron, and begged him to use his
influence in obtaining for her an engagement
at Drury Lane. She was the type of young
woman who aspires to a career on the stage,
or in any other field, without regard to qualifications,
and without the burden of study.
She wrote in her first letter (it had many
successors): “The theatre presents an easy
method of independence.” She objected vehemently
to “the intolerable drudgery of provincial
boards.” She wanted to appear at once in
London. And she signed her name, “Clara
Clairmont,” which was prettily alliterative, and
suited her better than Jane.</p>

<p>It was an inauspicious beginning of an unhappy
intimacy, destined to bring nothing but
disaster in its train. Miss Clairmont’s stepfather,
William Godwin, had confessed, not
without reason, “a feeling of incompetence for
the education of daughters.” His own child,
Mary, had fled to Europe eighteen months
before, with the poet Shelley. Miss Clairmont
accompanied their flight; and their inexplicable
folly in taking her with them was punished—as
folly always is—with a relentless severity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>
seldom accorded to sin. To the close of Shelley’s
life, his sister-in-law continued to be a
source of endless irritation and anxiety.</p>

<p>No engagement at Drury Lane was procurable.
Indeed, Miss Clairmont soon ceased to
desire one. Her infatuation for Lord Byron
drove all other thoughts and hopes and ambitions
from her heart. She wrote to him
repeatedly,—clever, foolish, half-mad, and
cruelly long letters. She praised the “wild
originality of his countenance.” She sent him
her manuscripts to read. There is something
pathetic in Byron’s unheeded entreaty that she
should “write short.” There is something immeasurably
painful in his unconcealed indifference,
in his undisguised contempt. The glamour
of his fame as a poet gave a compelling power
to that fatal beauty which was his undoing.
When we read what <em>men</em> have written about
Byron’s head; when we recall the rhapsodies
of Moore, the reluctant praise of Trelawney,
the eloquence of Coleridge; when we remember
that Scott—the sanest man in Great Britain—confessed
ruefully that Byron’s face was a
thing to dream of, we are the less surprised<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
that women should have flung themselves at his
feet in a frenzy of self-surrender, which a cold
legacy of busts and portraits does little to explain.
Miss Clairmont—to use one of Professor
Dowden’s flowers of speech—“was lightly
whirled out of her regular orbit.” In the spring
she travelled with Shelley and Mary Godwin to
Switzerland, and at Sécheron, a little suburb
of Geneva, they met Lord Byron, who was then
writing the splendid third canto of “Childe Harold.”
His letter to his sister, the Hon. Augusta
Leigh, bears witness to his annoyance at the
encounter; but the two poets became for a season
daily companions, and, in some sort, friends.
Shelley thought Byron “as mad as the winds”
(an opinion which was returned with interest),
and deeply regretted his slavery “to the vilest
and most vulgar prejudices;”—among them
a prejudice in favour of Christianity, for which
ancient institution Byron always entertained a
profound though unfruitful reverence. Indeed,
despite the revolutionary impetus of his verse,
and despite the fact that he died for revolting
Greece, the settled order of things appealed
with force to his eminently practical nature.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
“Sanity and balance,” says Mr. Morley, “mark
the foundations of his character. An angel of
reasonableness seems to watch over him, even
when he comes most dangerously near to an
extravagance.”</p>

<p>Miss Clairmont did not confide to her guardians
the secret of her intimacy with Lord Byron
until after the meeting at Geneva. When
her relations with him were understood, neither
Shelley nor Mary Godwin saw at first any
occasion for distress. They cared nothing for
the broken marriage bond, and they believed, or
hoped, that some true affection had been—as
in their own case—the impelling and upholding
power. It was the swift withering of this
hope which filled their hearts with apprehension.
They carried Miss Clairmont back to
England in the autumn (“I have had all the
plague possible to persuade her to go back,”
wrote Byron to his sister); and in Bath, the
following January, her little daughter was born.</p>

<p>It was a blue-eyed baby of exceptional loveliness.
Mrs. Shelley (Mary Godwin had been
married to the poet on the death of his wife,
two months earlier) fills her letters with praises<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
of its beauty. Miss Clairmont wrote to Byron
in 1820 that her health had been injured by
her “attentions” to her child during its first
year; but she found time to study Italian, and
to write a book, for which Shelley tried in vain
to find a publisher, and the very title of which
is now forgotten. The little household at Great
Marlow was not a tranquil one. Mrs. Shelley
had grown weary of her step-sister’s society.
Her diary—all these young people kept diaries
with uncommendable industry—abounds
in notes, illustrative of Claire’s ill-temper, and
of her own chronic irritation. “Clara imagines
that I treat her unkindly.” “Clara in an ill-humour.”
“Jane<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> gloomy.” “Jane for some
reason refuses to walk.” “Jane is not well,
and does not speak the whole day.”</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">1</a> Clara Mary Jane Clairmont was “Claire’s” full name.</p>

</div>

<p>This was bad enough, but there were other
moods more trying than mere sulkiness. Miss
Clairmont possessed nerves. She had “the
horrors” when “King Lear” was read aloud.
She was, or professed to be, afraid of ghosts.
She would come downstairs in the middle of
the night to tell Shelley that an invisible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
hand had lifted her pillow from her bed, and
dumped it on a chair. To such thrilling recitals
the poet lent serious attention. “Her
manner,” he wrote in his journal, “convinced
me that she was not deceived. We continued
to sit by the fire, at intervals engaged in awful
conversation, relative to the nature of these
mysteries;”—that is, to the migrations of the
pillow. As a result of sympathetic treatment,
Claire would wind up the night with hysterics,
writhing in convulsions on the floor, and shrieking
dismally, until poor Mrs. Shelley would
be summoned from a sick-bed to soothe her
to slumber. “Give me a garden, and <i lang="la">absentia</i>
Claire, and I will thank my love for many
favours,” is the weary comment of the wife,
after months of inextinguishable agitation.</p>

<p>There was no loophole of escape, however,
from a burden so rashly shouldered. Miss
Clairmont made one or two ineffectual efforts
at self-support; but found them little to her
liking. She could not, and she would not, live
with her mother, Mrs. Godwin;—“a very
disgusting woman, and wears green spectacles,”
is Charles Lamb’s description of this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
lady, whom, in common with most of her
acquaintances, he cordially disliked. When
Byron wrote, offering to receive and provide
for his little daughter, Shelley vehemently opposed
the plan, thinking it best that so young
an infant should remain under its mother’s
care. But his wife, who was at heart a singularly
sagacious woman, never ceased to urge
the advisability of the step. Claire, though
reluctant to part from her baby, yielded to
these persuasions; and the journey to Italy
in the spring of 1818 was undertaken mainly
as a sure though expensive method of conveying
Allegra to her father.</p>

<p>That Byron wanted the child, there is no
doubt, nor that he had been from the first
deeply concerned for her uncertain future.
Three months after her birth, he wrote to his
sister that he had resolved to send for her, and
place her in a convent, “to become a good
Catholic, and (it may be) a nun,—being a
character somewhat needed in our family.”
“They tell me,” he adds, “that she is very
pretty, with blue eyes and dark hair; and
although I never was attached, nor pretended<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
attachment to the mother, still, in case of the
eternal war and alienation which I foresee
about my legitimate daughter, Ada, it may be
as well to have something to repose a hope
upon. I must love something in my old age;
and circumstances may render this poor little
creature a great, and perhaps my only, comfort.”</p>

<p>It is not often that Byron’s letters reveal
this grace of sentiment. Never, after Allegra’s
arrival, does he allude to any affection he bears
her, and he once assured Moore that he did
not bear any;—a statement which that partial
biographer thought fit to disregard. On
the other hand, he dwells over and over again,
both in his correspondence and in his journal,
upon plans for her education and future settlement.
He was at all times sternly practical,
and pitilessly clear-sighted. He never regarded
his daughter as a “lovely toy,” but as a very
serious and troublesome responsibility. The
poetic view of childhood failed to appeal to
him. “Any other father,” wrote Claire bitterly,
“would have made of her infancy a sweet
idyl of flowers and innocent joy.” Byron was
not idyllic. He dosed Allegra with quinine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>
when she had a fever. He abandoned a meditated
journey because she was ill. He dismissed
a servant who had let her fall. He
added a codicil to his will, bequeathing her
five thousand pounds. These things do not
indicate any stress of emotion, but they have
their place in the ordinary calendar of parental
cares.</p>

<p>A delicate baby, not yet sixteen months old,
was a formidable and inharmonious addition to
the poet’s Venetian household. The Swiss nurse,
Elise, who had been sent by the Shelleys from
Milan, proved to be a most incapable and unworthy
woman, who later on made infinite mischief
by telling the foulest of lies. Byron was
sorely perplexed by the situation; and when
Mrs. Hoppner, the Genevan wife of the English
consul-general, offered to take temporary
charge of the child, he gladly and gratefully
consented. One difficulty in his path he had
not failed to foresee;—that Claire, having relinquished
Allegra of her own free will, would
quickly want her back again. In fact, before
the end of the summer, Miss Clairmont insisted
upon going to Venice, and poor Shelley very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
ruefully and reluctantly accompanied her.
Byron received <em>him</em> with genuine delight, and,
in an access of good humour, proposed lending
the party his villa at Este. There Mrs. Shelley,
who had lost her infant daughter, might recover
from sorrow and fatigue, and there Allegra
might spend some weeks under her mother’s
care. The offer was frankly accepted, and the
two men came once more to an amicable understanding.
They were not fitted to be friends,—the
gods had ruled a severance wide and
deep;—but when unpricked by the contentiousness
of other people, they passed pleasant
and profitable hours together.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the poor little apple of discord
was ripening every day into a fairer bloom.
“Allegra has been with me these three months,”
writes Byron to his sister in August. “She is
very pretty, remarkably intelligent, and a great
favourite with everybody.... She has very
blue eyes, a singular forehead, fair curly hair,
and a devil of a Spirit,—but that is Papa’s.”
“I have here my natural daughter, by name
Allegra,” he tells Moore six weeks later. “She
is a pretty little girl enough, and reckoned like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
Papa.” To Murray he writes in the same paternal
strain. “My daughter Allegra is well,
and growing pretty; her hair is growing darker,
and her eyes are blue. Her temper and her
ways, Mr. Hoppner says, are like mine, as well
as her features. She will make, in that case,
a manageable young lady.”</p>

<p>Other pens bear ready witness to Allegra’s
temper. Mr. Jeaffreson, who has written a
very offensive book about Lord Byron, takes
pains to tell us that the poor child was “greedy,
passionate, and, in her fifth year, precocious,
vain and saucy.” Mr. Hoppner, after the publication
of the Countess Guiccioli’s “Recollections,”
wrote an agitated letter to the “Athenæum,”
assuring an indifferent public that he
had no acquaintance with the lady, and that his
own respectability was untarnished by any intimacy
with the poet, of whose morals he disapproved,
and whose companionship he eschewed,
save when they rode together,—on Byron’s
horses. “Allegra was not by any means an
amiable child,” he added sourly, “nor was Mrs.
Hoppner nor I particularly fond of her.”</p>

<p>It could hardly have been expected that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>
daughter of Byron and Claire Clairmont would
have been “amiable;” nor can we wonder
that Mr. Hoppner, who had a seven-months-old
baby of his own, should have failed to
wax enthusiastic over another infant. But his
warm-hearted wife did love her little charge,
and grieved sincerely when the child’s quick
temper subsided into listlessness under the
fierce Italian heat. “<span lang="fr">Mon petit brille, et il
est toujours gai et sautillant</span>,” she wrote prettily
to the Shelleys, after their departure from
Venice; “<span lang="fr">et Allegra, par contre, est devenue
tranquille et sérieuse, comme une petite vieille,
ce que nous peine beaucoup</span>.”</p>

<p>Byron was frankly grateful to Mrs. Hoppner
for her kindness to his daughter; and after he
had carried the child to Ravenna, where the
colder, purer air brought back her gayety and
bloom, he wrote again and again to her former
guardians, now thanking them for “a whole
treasure of toys” which they had sent, now
assuring them that “Allegrina is flourishing
like a pomegranate blossom,” and now reiterating
the fact which seemed to make most impression
upon his mind,—that she was growing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>
prettier and more obstinate every day. He
added many little details about her childish
ailments, her drives with the Countess Guiccioli,
and her popularity in his household. It
was to the over-indulgence of his servants, as
well as to heredity, that he traced her high
temper and imperious will. He consulted Mrs.
Hoppner more than once about Allegra’s
education; and he poured into her husband’s
ears his bitter resentment at Miss Clairmont’s
pardonable, but exasperating interference.</p>

<p>For Claire, clever about most things, was
an adept in the art of provocation. She wrote
him letters calculated to try the patience of
a saint, and he retaliated by a cruel and contemptuous
silence. In vain Shelley attempted
to play the difficult part of peacemaker. “I
wonder,” he pleaded, “at your being provoked
by what Claire writes, though that she should
write what is provoking is very probable. You
are conscious of performing your duty to Allegra,
and your refusal to allow her to visit
Claire at this distance you conceive to be part
of that duty. That Claire should have wished
to see her is natural. That her disappointment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>
should vex her, and her vexation make her
write absurdly, is all in the natural order of
things. But, poor thing, she is very unhappy
and in bad health, and she ought to be treated
with as much indulgence as possible. The
weak and the foolish are in this respect the
kings,—they can do no wrong.”</p>

<p>Byron was less generous. The weak and
the foolish—especially when their weakness
and folly took the form of hysteria—irritated
him beyond endurance. The penalty that an
hysterical woman pays for her self-indulgence
is that no one believes in the depth or sincerity
of her emotions. Byron had no pity for the
pain that Claire was suffering. She was to him
simply a young woman who never lost an opportunity
to make a scene, and he hated scenes.
On one point he was determined. Allegra
should never again be sent to her mother, nor
to the Shelleys. He had views of his own upon
the education of little girls, which by no means
corresponded with theirs.</p>

<p>“About Allegra,” he writes to Mr. Hoppner
in 1820, “I can only say to Claire that I
so totally disapprove of the mode of Children’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>
treatment in their family, that I should look
upon the Child as going into a hospital. Is it
not so? Have they reared one? Her health
has hitherto been excellent, and her temper not
bad. She is sometimes vain and obstinate, but
always clean and cheerful; and as, in a year
or two, I shall either send her to England, or
put her in a Convent for education, these
defects will be remedied as far as they can in
human nature. But the Child shall not quit
me again to perish of Starvation and green
fruit, or be taught to believe that there is no
Deity. Whenever there is convenience of vicinity
and access, her Mother can always have her
with her; otherwise no. It was so stipulated
from the beginning.”</p>

<p>Five months later, he reiterates these painfully
prosaic views. He has taken a house in
the country, because the air agrees better with
Allegra. He has two maids to attend her.
He is doing his best, and he is very angry at
Claire’s last batch of letters. “Were it not for
the poor little child’s sake,” he writes, “I am
almost tempted to send her back to her atheistical
mother, but that would be too bad.... If<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>
Claire thinks that she shall ever interfere with
the child’s morals or education, she mistakes;
she never shall. The girl shall be a Christian,
and a married woman, if possible.”</p>

<p>On these two points Byron had set his heart.
The Countess Guiccioli—kindly creature—assures
us that “his dearest paternal care was
the religious training to be given to his natural
daughter, Allegra;” and while the words of
this sweet advocate weigh little in the scale,
they are in some degree confirmed by the poet’s
conduct and correspondence. When he felt
the growing insecurity of his position in Ravenna,
he determined to place the child at a
convent school twelve miles away, and he explained
very clearly and concisely to all whom
it might concern his reasons for the step. “Allegra
is now four years old complete,” he wrote
to Mr. Hoppner in April, 1821; “and as she
is quite above the control of the servants, and
as a man living without any woman at the
head of his house cannot much attend to a nursery,
I had no resource but to place her for a
time (at a high pension too) in the convent of
Bagnacavallo (twelve miles off), where the air<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>
is good, and where she will, at least, have her
learning advanced, and her morals and religion
inculcated. I had also another motive. Things
were and are in such a state here, that I have
no reason to look upon my own personal safety
as insurable, and thought the infant best out
of harm’s way for the present.</p>

<p>“It is also fit that I should add that I by no
means intended nor intend to give a natural
child an English education, because, with the
disadvantages of her birth, her after settlement
would be doubly difficult. Abroad, with a fair
foreign education, and a portion of five or six
thousand pounds, she might and may marry
very respectably. In England, such a dowry
would be a pittance, while elsewhere it is a
fortune. It is, besides, my wish that she should
be a Roman Catholic, a religion which I look
upon as the best, as it is assuredly the oldest,
of the various branches of Christianity. I have
now explained my notions as to the place where
she is. It is the best I could find for the present,
but I have no prejudices in its favour.”</p>

<p>Both Mr. and Mrs. Hoppner were strongly
in favour of a Swiss, rather than an Italian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>
school; and Byron, who never doubted the
sincerity of their affection for his child, lent a
ready ear to their suggestions. “If I had but
known your ideas about Switzerland before,”
he wrote to Mr. Hoppner in May; “I should
have adopted them at once. As it is, I shall
let Allegra remain in her convent, where she
seems healthy and happy, for the present. But
I shall feel much obliged if you will inquire,
when you are in the cantons, about the usual
and better modes of education there for females,
and let me know the result of your
inquiries. It is some consolation that both
Mr. and Mrs. Shelley have written to approve
entirely of my placing the child with the nuns
for the present. I can refer to my whole conduct,
as having spared no trouble, nor kindness,
nor expense, since she was sent to me.
People may say what they please. I must content
myself with not deserving (in this case)
that they should speak ill.</p>

<p>“The place is a country town, in a good air,
where there is a large establishment for education,
and many children, some of considerable
rank, placed in it. As a country town, it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>
less liable to objections of every kind. It has
always appeared to me that the moral defect
in Italy does not proceed from a conventual
training,—because, to my certain knowledge,
girls come out of their convents innocent,
even to ignorance, of moral evil;—but to the
society into which they are plunged directly
on coming out of it. It is like educating an
infant on a mountain top, and then taking
him to the sea, and throwing him into it, and
desiring him to swim.”</p>

<p>Other letters to Mr. Hoppner, to Shelley,
and to Moore are equally practical and explicit.
Byron writes that he has regular reports of
Allegra’s health; that she has mastered her
alphabet; that he is having her reared a Catholic,
“so that she may have her hands full;”
that he meditates increasing her dowry, “if
I live, and she is correct in her conduct;” that
he thinks a Swiss gentleman might make her
a better husband than an Italian. Pamela the
virtuous was not more set upon her own “marriage
lines” than was Lord Byron upon his
daughter’s. Respectability was the golden boon
he coveted for the poor little pledge of an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
illicit and unhappy passion. No one knew better
than he how well it is to walk a safe and
sheltered road; and no correct church-going
father in England was ever more concerned
for the decent settlement of his child.</p>

<p>There were others who took a more impassioned
view of the situation. Miss Clairmont
was spending her Carnival merrily in Florence,
when word came that Allegra had been
sent to school. It was a blow, says Professor
Dowden, “under which she staggered and
reeled.” In vain Shelley and his wife represented
to her the wisdom of the step. In vain
Byron wrote that the air of the Romagna was
exceptionally good, and that he paid double fees
for his little daughter, to insure her every care
and attention. Claire, piteously unreasonable,
answered only with frenzied reproaches and
appeals. She taunted the poet with his unhappy
married life,—which was applying
vitriol to a raw wound; she inveighed against
the “ignorance and degradation” of convent-reared
women, she implored permission to
carry her child to England. “I propose,” she
wrote, with maddening perversity, “to place<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>
her at my own expense in one of the very best
English boarding-schools, where, if she is deprived
of the happiness of a home and paternal
care, she at least would receive an English
education, which would enable her, after many
years of painful and unprotected childhood, to
be benefited by the kindness and affection of
her parents’ friends.... By adopting this
plan, you will save yourself credit and also
the expense; and the anxiety for her safety
and well-being need never trouble you. You
will become as free as if you had no such tie.”</p>

<p>As an example of the purely exasperating,
this letter has few peers in recorded correspondence.
“At my own expense,” meant at
Shelley’s expense; and Byron, loving or unloving,
had never sought to shirk his paternal
responsibilities. The alluring prospect of freedom
from all concern offered little temptation
to a father who had his child’s future very
seriously at heart. Miss Clairmont was surrounded
at this time by a group of eminently
foolish counsellors, the most prominent of
whom were Lady Mountcashell, Mr. Tighe,
and Miss Elizabeth Parker. Lady Mountcashell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>
had a venerable husband in England,
but preferred living in Italy with Mr. Tighe.
There she employed her leisure in writing a
book upon the training of children,—a work
which her friends highly esteemed, and which
they held to be an ample compensation to
society for any irregularities in her own life.
The couple were known as Mr. and Mrs.
Mason. Miss Parker was an orphan girl, sent
from England by Mrs. Godwin to be a companion
to Lady Mountcashell, and profit by
her example. These people kept alive in
Claire’s heart the flame of resentment and
unrest. Mr. Tighe dwelt mournfully upon the
austerity, as well as upon the degradation of
convent life, until the mother’s grief grew so
excessive that in August, 1821, the long-suffering
Shelley made a pilgrimage to Ravenna and
to Bagnacavallo, to see how Allegra was placed,
and to assure himself of her health and happiness.
His charming letter—too long to be
quoted in full—gives us the prettiest imaginable
picture of a little school-girl, not yet five
years old.</p>

<p>“I went the other day to see Allegra at her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>
convent, and stayed with her about three
hours. She is grown tall and slight for her
age, and her face is somewhat altered. She
yet retains the beauty of her deep blue eyes
and of her mouth; but she has a contemplative
seriousness, which, mixed with her excessive
vivacity which has not yet deserted her, has a
very peculiar effect in a child. She is under
strict discipline, as may be observed from the
immediate obedience she accords to the will of
her attendants. This seems contrary to her
nature; but I do not think it has been obtained
at the expense of much severity. Her
hair, scarcely darker than it was, is beautifully
profuse, and hangs in large curls on her neck.
She was prettily dressed in white muslin, and
an apron of black silk, with trousers. Her
light and airy figure and her graceful motions
were a striking contrast to the other children
there. She seemed a thing of a finer and a
higher order. At first she was very shy; but
after a little caressing, and especially after I
had given her a gold chain which I had bought
for her at Ravenna, she grew more familiar,
and led me all over the garden, and all over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>
the convent, running and skipping so fast that
I could hardly keep up with her. She showed
me her little bed, and the chair where she sat at
dinner, and the <i lang="co">carozzina</i> in which she and her
favourite companions drew each other along a
walk in the garden. I had brought her a basket
of sweetmeats, and, before eating any of
them, she gave her friends and each of the
nuns a portion. This is not like the old Allegra....
Her intellect is not much cultivated.
She knows certain <i lang="it">orazioni</i> by heart, and talks
and dreams of <i lang="it">Paradiso</i> and all sorts of things,
and has a prodigious list of saints, and is always
talking of the Bambino. This will do her no
harm; but the idea of bringing up so sweet a
creature in the midst of such trash ‘till sixteen.”</p>

<p>Shelley’s content with Allegra’s situation
(the little tempest-tossed bark had at last sailed
into quiet waters) failed to bring comfort to
Claire. The convent walls rose—a hopeless
barrier—between mother and child; and the
finality of the separation weighed cruelly upon
her spirits. One of her most bitter grievances
was the fear that her daughter was being educated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span>
with the children of tradespeople,—an
unfounded alarm, as we see from the list compiled
by Signor Biondi of the little <i lang="it">marchesas</i>
and <i lang="it">contessas</i> who were Allegra’s playmates.
Another, and a reasonable anxiety, came with
the approach of winter. Miss Clairmont then
thinks less about the ignorance and immorality
of Italian women, and more about the undoubted
cold of Italian convents. She is afraid,
and naturally afraid, that her child is not warm
enough. There is one piteous letter in which
she says that she cannot look at a glowing fire
without a sorrowful remembrance of her little
daughter in the chilly convent halls.</p>

<p>All these sources of disquietude were strengthened
the following year by a new and unreasoning
terror. Miss Clairmont appears to have
actually persuaded herself that Lord Byron
meant to leave Allegra at Bagnacavallo, in the
event of his own departure from Italy. We
know now from his letters that it was his
settled purpose to take her with him, wherever
he went. Even when he meditated—briefly—an
exile to South America, the child was to
accompany his flight. But his persistent silence,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>
his maddening refusal to answer Claire’s appeals
or remonstrances, left her in painful
ignorance, and a prey to consuming fears. She
conceived the mad design of stealing Allegra
from the convent,—a scheme which was
warmly supported by those discreet monitors,
Lady Mountcashell and Mr. Tighe. Together
they discussed ways and means. Mr. Tighe
was of the opinion that the time had come for
extreme measures; and the ardent Miss Parker
assured Miss Clairmont that, were <em>she</em> Allegra’s
mother, she would not hesitate to stab Lord
Byron to the heart, and so free his unhappy
offspring from captivity.</p>

<p>In the midst of this melodramatic turmoil
we hear Mrs. Shelley’s voice, pleading vainly
for patience and common sense. She points
out in an earnest letter to Claire that Lady
Noel’s death will probably compel Byron to go
to England, and may even lead to a reconciliation
with his wife. In that event he will be
more willing to give back Allegra to her
mother; and for the present, there is no cause
for apprehension. “Your anxiety about the
child’s health,” she writes reassuringly, “is to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>
a great extent unfounded. You ought to know,
and any one will tell you, that the towns of
Romagna, situated where Bagnacavallo is, enjoy
the best air in Italy. Imola and the neighbouring
<i lang="it">paese</i> are famous. Bagnacavallo especially,
being fifteen miles from the sea, and situated
on an eminence, is peculiarly salutary. Considering
the affair reasonably, Allegra is well
taken care of there. She is in good health, and
in all probability will continue so.”</p>

<p>One fact she strives to make clear. Her husband
has no money for the furtherance of any
plots that Miss Clairmont and Mr. Tighe may
devise. On this score, Shelley himself is equally
explicit. He had never wanted Allegra to go
to her father, and he cannot resist the temptation
of saying, “I told you so,” though he says
it with grave kindness. But he was even less
willing that, having been given up, she should be
stolen back again. His letter of remonstrance
proves both the anxiety he felt, and his sense
of shame at the part he was expected to play.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Clare</span>,—I know not what to
think of the state of your mind, nor what to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span>
fear for you. Your plan about Allegra seems
to me, in its present form, pregnant with irremediable
infamy to all the actors in it except
yourself;—in any form wherein <em>I</em> must actively
coöperate, with inevitable destruction.
<em>I could not</em> refuse Lord Byron’s challenge;
though that, however to be deprecated, would
be the least in the series of mischiefs consequent
upon my intervention in such a plan. I
am shocked at the thoughtless violence of your
designs, and I wish to put my sense of their
madness in the strongest light. I may console
myself, however, with the reflection that the
attempt even is impossible, as I have no money.
So far from being ready to lend me three or
four hundred pounds, Horace Smith has lately
declined to advance six or seven napoleons for
a musical instrument which I wished to buy

<p>There was no need of heroics on the one side,
nor of apprehension on the other. While Miss
Clairmont was fretting and scheming in Florence,
fever was scourging the Romagna, so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>
seldom visited by infection, and the little English-born
girl fell one of its earliest victims.
Allegra died at her convent school in the spring
of 1822. Byron admitted that death was kind.
“Her position in the world would scarcely have
allowed her to be happy,” he said, pitying remorsefully
the “sinless child of sin,” so harshly
handicapped in life. But he felt his loss, and
bitterly, though silently, mourned it. The
Countess Guiccioli was with him when the
tidings came. In her eyes, he had always been
a fond and solicitous father; yet the violence of
his distress amazed and frightened her. He
sent her away, and faced his grief, and his remorse—if
he felt remorse—alone. The next
day, when she sought him, he said very simply,
“It is God’s will. She is more fortunate than
we are;” and never spoke of the child again.
“From that time,” she adds, “he became more
anxious about his daughter Ada;—so much
so as to disquiet himself when the usual accounts
sent him were for a post or two delayed.”</p>

<p>Byron’s letters to Shelley, to Murray, and to
Scott, bear witness to the sincerity of his grief,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>
and also to his sense of compunction. He was
still ready to defend his conduct; but to Shelley,
at least, he admitted: “It is a moment
when we are apt to think that, if this or that
had been done, such an event might have been
prevented.” Indeed, of the four actors so deeply
concerned in this brief tragedy of life, Shelley
alone could hold himself free from blame.
From first to last he had been generous, reasonable,
and kind. It was his painful part to comfort
Miss Clairmont, to restrain her frenzy of
anger and wretchedness, to make what shadow
of peace he could between the parents of the
dead child. In all this he endured more than
his share of worry and vexation. Two weeks
after Allegra’s death, he wrote to Lord Byron:</p>

<p>“I have succeeded in dissuading Clare from
the melancholy design of visiting the coffin at
Leghorn, much to the profit of my own shattered
health and spirits, which would have suffered
greatly in accompanying her on such a
journey. She is much better. She has, indeed,
altogether suffered in a manner less terrible than
I expected, after the first shock, during which,
of course, she wrote the letter you enclose. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span>
had no idea that her letter was written in that
temper; and I think I need not assure you
that, whatever mine or Mary’s ideas might have
been respecting the system of education you
intended to adopt, we sympathize too much in
your loss, and appreciate too well your feelings,
to have allowed such a letter to be sent to you,
had we suspected its contents.”</p>

<p>A dead grief is easier to bear than a live
trouble. By early summer, Shelley was able
to report Miss Clairmont as once more “talkative
and vivacious.” It was he who befriended
her to the end, and who bequeathed her a large
share of his estate. It was he who saw—or
deemed he saw—the image of Allegra rise
smiling and beckoning from the sea.</p>

<p>According to the Countess Guiccioli, Byron
bore the “profound sorrow” occasioned by his
little daughter’s death “with all the fortitude
belonging to his great soul.” In reality his
sense of loss was tempered by relief. Allegra’s
future had always been to him a subject of
anxiety, and it was not without an emotion of
joy that he realized the child’s escape from a
world which he had found bad, and which he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>
had done little to make better. Two days after
she died, he wrote to Murray: “You will regret
to hear that I have received intelligence
of the death of my daughter, Allegra, of a fever,
in the convent of Bagnacavallo, where she was
placed for the last year to commence her education.
It is a heavy blow for many reasons,
but must be borne,—with time.”</p>

<p>A fortnight later he wrote to Scott: “I
have just lost my natural daughter, Allegra,
by a fever. The only consolation, save time, is
the reflection that she is either at rest or happy;
for her few years (only five) prevented her
from having incurred any sin, except what we
inherit from Adam.</p>

<p class="center">
“‘Whom the gods love die young.’”
</p>

<p>In a third letter, published by Mr. Prothero,
Byron repeats these sentiments with even
greater emphasis, and with a keener appreciation
of their value. “Death has done his work,
and I am resigned.... Even at my age I
have become so much worn and harassed by
the trials of the world, that I cannot refrain
from looking upon that early rest which is at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span>
times granted to the young, as a blessing.
There is a purity and holiness in the apotheosis
of those who leave us in their brightness
and their beauty, which instinctively lead us
to a persuasion of their beatitude.”</p>

<p>It was the irony of fate that, after being
an innocent object of contention all her life,
Allegra should, even in death, have been made
the theme of an angry and bitter dispute. Her
body was sent to England, and Byron begged
Murray to make all the necessary arrangements
for her burial. His directions were exceedingly
minute. He indicated the precise spot in Harrow
Church where he wished the child interred,
and he wrote the inscription to be engraved
upon her tablet.</p>

<p class="in0">The funeral he desired to be “as private as is
consistent with decency;” and he expressed
a hope that his friend, the Rev. Henry Drury,
would read the church service.</p>

<p>Murray found himself beset by unexpected
difficulties. The vicar of Harrow, the Rev.
J.&nbsp;W. Cunningham, objected strenuously to
the erection of Allegra’s tablet, and stated his
objections at length;—not to Lord Byron
(which was prudent), but to the unhappy
publisher, who, all his life, had everybody’s
business to attend to. Mr. Cunningham declared
that the proposed inscription “would be
felt by every man of refined taste, to say nothing
of sound morals, to be an offence against
taste and propriety.” He explained cautiously
that, as he did not dare to say this to Byron,
he expected Murray to do so. “My correspondence
with his Lordship has been so
small that I can scarcely venture myself to
urge these objections. You, perhaps, will feel
no such scruple. I have seen no person who
did not concur in the propriety of stating
them. I would intreat, however, that, should
you think it right to introduce my name<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span>
into any statement made to Lord Byron”
(as if it could well have been left out),
“you will not do so without assuring him
of my unwillingness to oppose the smallest
obstacle to his wishes, or give the slightest
pain to his mind. The injury which, in my
judgment, he is from day to day inflicting upon
society is no justification for measures of
retaliation and unkindness.”</p>

<p>Even the expansive generosity of this last
sentiment failed to soften Byron’s wrath, when
the vicar’s scruples were communicated to him.
He anathematized the reverend gentleman in
language too vigorous for repetition, and he
demanded of Murray, “what was the matter
with the inscription,”—apparently under the
impression that he had mistaken his dates, or
misquoted his text. His anger deepened into
fury when he was subsequently informed that
Allegra’s interment in Harrow Church was held
to be a deliberate insult to Lady Byron, who occasionally
attended the services there. He wrote
passionately that of his wife’s church-goings he
knew nothing; but that, had he known, no
power would have induced him to bury his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span>
poor infant where her foot might tread upon
its grave. Meanwhile, Mr. Cunningham had
marshalled his church-wardens, who obediently
withheld their consent to the erection of the
tablet; so that matter was settled forever.
Two years later, Dr. Ireland, Dean of Westminster,
refused to permit Lord Byron’s body
to be buried in Westminster Abbey. Even
Thorwaldsen’s statue of the poet, now in
Trinity College, Cambridge, was rejected by
this conscientious dignitary. “I do indeed
greatly wish for a figure by Thorwaldsen here,”
he wrote piously to Murray; “but no taste
ought to be indulged to the prejudice of a
duty.” The statue lay unheeded for months
in a shed on the Thames wharf, and was
finally transferred to the library of Trinity
College, Cambridge. Comment is superfluous.
Byron was denied a grave in Westminster
Abbey; but Gifford, through Dr. Ireland’s
especial insistence, was buried within its
walls.</p>

<p>Allegra lies in Harrow Church, with no
tablet to mark her resting-place, or to preserve
her memory. Visitors searching sentimentally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span>
for “Byron’s tomb,”—by which they mean a
stone in the churchyard, “on the brow of
the hill, looking towards Windsor,” where,
as a boy, he was wont to sit and dream for
hours,—seldom know the spot where his little
daughter sleeps.</p>
